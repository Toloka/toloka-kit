1.2.2
-------------------
Changes:
* Updated Apps API-related `TolokaClient` and `AsyncTolokaClient` methods to support new features.

1.2.1
-------------------
Python versions support:
* Python 3.7 support dropped

Changes:
* Updated `TolokaClient.create_app_items` and `AsyncTolokaClient.create_app_items` to return the list of created app 
items ids.
* Added `tier` parameter to `TolokaClient.create_pool` and `AsyncTolokaClient.create_pool` methods.

1.2.0.post1
-------------------
Bugfixes:
* Fixed OAuth authorization header generation.

1.2.0
-------------------
Changes:
* Changed streaming cursors behavior: now events are processed not sooner than `time_lag` seconds after they were 
  created. This parameter is configurable, but it is not recommended to decrease the default value of 1 minute as this 
  can lead to some events being skipped. This change affects streaming cursors, cursor-based streaming observers, and 
  some cursor-based metric collectors. 

Features:
* Supported SSO authorization tokens.
* Added Python 3.11 support
* `TolokaClient.create_task`, `TolokaClient.create_task_suite` and `TolokaClient.create_user_bonus` now support 
  `operation_id` parameter.

Fixes:
* `TolokaClient.create_task`, `TolokaClient.create_task_suite`, `TolokaClient.create_user_bonus` and 
  `TolokaClient.create_user_bonus` can be safely retried now (previously they could create duplicate items in case of 
  an unstable connection).
* Previously `AsyncTolokaClient` could not outlive the asyncio event loop which was used during the first API call, 
  which lead to an inability to pickle `AsyncTolokaClient`. Now `AsyncTolokaClient` survives asyncio event loop change.
* `TolokaClient` and `AsyncTolokaClient` follows `urllib3` retrying behavior more closely in case of the `Retry` object 
  being passed to the `retry` or `retryer_factory` parameters.
* Previously streaming cursors could skip some Toloka events when fetching them from the API concurrently with them 
  being created. Now streaming cursors utilize time lag to prevent such concurrent reads.


1.1.4
-------------------
Features:
* Added `verify` parameter to `TolokaClient` and `AsyncTolokaClient`. This parameter controls SSL certificate verification settings.

Bugfixes:
* Fixed deserialization of legacy Toloka projects bug which was caused by an attempt to parse view spec with empty `lock` field.


1.1.3
-------------------
Bugfixes:
* Removed upper bound on `cattrs` version.
* While structuring objects with unknown `spec_value` corresponding classes are generated in runtime now. Thus objects like filters, rule actions and others that are not fully documented in api/experimental/removed in past from toloka-kit could be safely structured now.

1.1.2
-------------------
Bugfixes:
* Methods for the batch creation of tasks, task suites or user bonuses could create duplicate items in case of unstable connection:
  * `TolokaClient.create_tasks_async`, `TolokaClient.create_task_suites_async` and `TolokaClient.create_user_bonuses_async` as well as `TolokaClient.create_tasks`, `TolokaClient.create_task_suites` with `async_mode=True` now guaranteed to create not more than one batch of items for a single function call.
  * `TolokaClient.create_user_bonuses` and `TolokaClient.create_user_bonus` are guaranteed to create not more than one batch of items for a single function call but may raise an exception if there was an attempt to create the same batch of items for the second time due to the unstable connection.

1.1.1
-------------------
Features:
* Introduced `batch_size` parameter to `TolokaClient.get_*` methods family. This parameter can be used to control the items limit for every underlying request that is made while iterating.

Deprecated:
* CAPTCHA frequency and CAPTCHA-based quality control settings are deprecated and will be removed in the future. CAPTCHAs are now included automatically for better quality control.

Bugfixes:
* `AsyncTolokaClient` can be serialized and deserialized with pickle now.

1.1.0
-------------------
Features:
* `AsyncTolokaClient` rework. Previously `AsyncTolokaClient` was a simple wrapper over `TolokaClient` that provided asynchrony via threading. This lead to poor performance and instability in the case of many concurrent connections. With the current release, `AsyncTolokaClient` is implemented with native python async code and `httpx` async networking provider internally, fixing all the above problems.

Deprecated:
* All `AsyncTolokaClient` methods returning generators now return async generators. Currently, the old (synchronous) iteration syntax is still supported via an adapter, but we encourage you to switch to the new (asynchronous) one.
Example:
```python
async_toloka_client = AsyncTolokaClient(...)

# deprecated syntax, support will be dropped in the feature
for assignment in await async_toloka_client.get_assignments(...):
    ...

# recommended syntax
async for assignment in async_toloka_client.get_assignments(...):
    ...
```


Changes:
* Toloka-Kit now internally uses `httpx` library instead of `requests`.

Bug fixes:
* `TolokaClient.create_task_suites` now returns response of the correct type.

1.0.2
-------------------
Features:
* `Pipeline` class can be manually iterated now using `Pipeline.run_manually` method.
* `Pipeline` now supports `iteration_mode` parameter, which controls whether the new iteration will start only after the completion of all tasks.  

1.0.1
-------------------
Features:
* Some filters now support inversion using "~" operator.
* Improved error messages.
* Added new `Verified` filter.

Bug fixes:
* Filters created using Toloka-Kit now should be rendered correctly in the Toloka UI.
* `Languages.include` now works correctly in case of multiple languages being passed.


1.0.0, 1.0.0rc1
-------------------

**Breaking changes**:
* By default only the core version of the package with minimized dependencies size is installed. The following objects were 
extracted into package extras:
  * `TolokaClient.get_assignments_df` method now requires `toloka-kit[pandas]`;
  * `toloka.metrics.jupyter_dashboard` module now requires `toloka-kit[jupyter-metrics]`;
  * `ZooKeeperLocker` class now requires `toloka-kit[zookeeper]` installed;
  * `S3Storage` class now requires `toloka-kit[s3]`.

  To install all optional dependencies (the same behavior as in pre-1.0.0 releases) use `toloka-kit[all]`.

* `SubmittedAssignmentsCountPoolAnalytics` class is renamed to `SubmitedAssignmentsCountPoolAnalytics`.

Features:
* `TolokaClient.wait_operation` now shows progress bar of submitted operation. This behavior can be disabled with 
the `disable_progress=True` parameter.
* Supported `infer_data_spec` option in `TemplateBuilderViewSpec`. This option allows you to control whether data 
specifications will be inferred from the provided view spec or not.
* New `autoquality` usage example. 
* New verified languages in the `Languages` filter.
* New `TolokaClient` option: `act_under_account_id`. This option allows you to act using a shared account without 
a token of this account.
* New `TolokaClient` methods: `TolokaClient.find_operations` and `TolokaClient.get_operations`. These methods allow 
you to list operations in the same way as the other `find_*` and `get_*` methods. 
* New `TolokaClient.get_user` method which allows you to get information about one specific Toloker.
* Massive improvements in documentation.

Changes:
* https://toloka.dev and https://sandbox.toloka.dev domains are now used for the API requests. 

0.1.26
-------------------

Features:
* Added `toloka.autoquality` - a tool for autogeneration of quality control rules
* Added `speed_quality_balance` attribute to `Pool`

0.1.25
-------------------

Fixes:
* Fix add new observers error.

0.1.24 [YANKED]
-------------------

Fixes:
* Status code 409 is no longer retried by default.
* Status code 504 is now retried by default.
* Fixed bug when `AppItem.errors` have been structured incorrectly.
* Fixed the bug when an incorrect version of the `urllib3` was used.

Changes:
* `toloka.client.filters.Rating` was removed according to changes in Toloka API.
* All time data now have a UTC timezone by default (instead of a local timezone).

Streaming improvements:
* `toloka.streaming.Pipeline` now supports "gentle shutdown": the first SIGINT received will force the `Pipeline` to process all observers in the current iteration and then exit. On the second SIGINT received, the `Pipeline` will be interrupted (warning: this may lead to errors such as incorrect saved observers states).
* `toloka.streaming.Pipeline` now supports registering new observers during execution.
* Observers now support `delete`, `disable`, and `enable` methods: these methods change the target Observer state such that `toloka.streaming.Pipeline` handles it accordingly.

Other improvements:
* Added [MapView](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/toloka-kit/reference/toloka.client.project.template_builder.view.MapViewV1) Template Builder component.

    """This collector helps you to reassign task suites completed by blocked Tolokers.

    The collector can be used with conditions:
    * [PoolAccessRevokedReason](toloka.client.conditions.PoolAccessRevokedReason.md) — The reason why the Toloker has lost access to the pool.
    * [SkillId](toloka.client.conditions.SkillId.md) — The ID of a skill if reason is `SKILL_CHANGE`.

    The collector can be used with actions:
    * [ChangeOverlap](toloka.client.actions.ChangeOverlap.md) changes the overlap of a task suite.

    Example:
        The example shows how to reassign rejected assignments to other Tolokers.

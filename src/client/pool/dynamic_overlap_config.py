    """Dynamic overlap settings.

    Toloka can automatically increase an overlap of tasks if the confidence level of aggregated responses is not high enough.

    Dynamic overlap uses the `BASIC` algorithm.
    Each response is assigned a weight depending on the Toloker's skill value.
    The aggregated response confidence is calculated based on the probability algorithm.
    The task overlap increases until it reaches `max_overlap` or until the confidence of the aggregated response exceeds `min_confidence`.

    Note, that if you use dynamic overlap, then set the `auto_close_after_complete_delay_seconds` pool parameter to a non zero value.

    Attributes:
        type: The dynamic overlap algorithm.
        max_overlap: Maximum overlap. The value must be higher than the default overlap value. Allowed range: from 1 to 30,000.
        min_confidence: Minimum required confidence of the aggregated response. Allowed range: from 0 to 1.
        answer_weight_skill_id: A skill that determines the weight of the Toloker's responses.
            For the best results, use a skill calculated as a percentage of correct responses in control tasks.
        fields: A list of output data fields used for aggregating responses.
            For the best results, each field must have a limited number of response options.
            Don't specify fields in the list together if they depend on each other.

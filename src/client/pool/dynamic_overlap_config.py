    Allows you to change the overlap depending on how well the performers handle the task.

    When all pool tasks are completed, aggregate the responses.

        type: The algorithm for dynamic overlap.
        max_overlap: Maximum overlap. Must be higher than the values in defaults. Minimum — 1. Maximum — 30000.
        min_confidence: Minimum confidence of the aggregated response. Values from 0 to 1.
        answer_weight_skill_id: A skill that determines the weight of the performer's response. For best results, use
            a skill calculated as percentage of correct responses in control tasks.

class Pool(BaseTolokaObject):
    """A set of [tasks](toloka.client.task.Task.md) that share the same properties.

    In the pool properties, you set the task price, overlap, Toloker selection filters, quality control rules, and so on.

    Pool tasks are grouped into [task suites](toloka.client.task_suite.TaskSuite.md). Whole task suites are assigned to Tolokers.

    Learn more in the Requester's guide about:
    * [Pools](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/pool-main)
    * [Pricing](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/dynamic-pricing)

    Attributes:
        project_id: The ID of the project containing the pool.
        private_name: The pool name. It is visible to the requester and is not visible to Tolokers.
        may_contain_adult_content: The presence of adult content.
        reward_per_assignment: Payment in US dollars for a Toloker for completing a task suite. For cents, use the dot as a separator.
            If the pool `type` is `REGULAR`, the minimum payment per task suite is $0.005. For other pool types, you can set the `reward_per_assignment` to zero.
        assignment_max_duration_seconds: Time limit to complete one task suite.
            Take into account loading a page with a task suite and sending responses to the server. It is recommended that you set at least 60 seconds.
            Tasks not completed within the limit are reassigned to other Tolokers.
        defaults: Default settings that are applied to new tasks in the pool.
        will_expire: The UTC date and time when the pool is closed automatically, even if not all tasks are completed.
        private_comment: A comment about the pool. It is visible to the requester and is not visible to Tolokers.
        public_description: The pool description. If pool's `public_description` is not set, then project's `public_description` is used.
        public_instructions: The pool instructions for Tolokers. If pool's `public_instructions` is not set, then project's `public_instructions` is used.
        auto_close_after_complete_delay_seconds: The pool remains open after all tasks are completed during the specified time in seconds.

            Use non zero value if:
            * You process data in real time.
            * The pool must stay open so that you can upload new tasks.
            * Dynamic overlap is enabled in the pool.

            Allowed range: from 0 to 259200 seconds (3 days). The default value is 0.
        dynamic_pricing_config: The dynamic pricing settings.
        auto_accept_solutions:
            * True — Responses from Tolokers are accepted or rejected automatically based on some rules.
            * False — Responses are checked manually. Time reserved for checking is limited by the `auto_accept_period_day` parameter.
                Learn more about [non-automatic acceptance](https://toloka.ai/en/docs/guide/concepts/offline-accept).
        auto_accept_period_day: The number of days reserved for checking responses if the `auto_accept_solutions` parameter is set to `False`.
        assignments_issuing_config: Settings for assigning tasks in the pool.
        priority: The priority of the pool in relation to other pools in the project with the same task price and set of filters.
            Tolokers are assigned tasks with a higher priority first.

            Allowed range: from 0 to 100. The default value is 0.
        filter: Settings for Toloker selection filters.
        quality_control: Settings for quality control rules and the ID of the pool with training tasks.
        speed_quality_balance: Settings for choosing Tolokers for your tasks.
        dynamic_overlap_config: Dynamic overlap settings.
        mixer_config: Parameters for automatically creating task suites.
        training_config: Additional settings for linked training.
        metadata: A dictionary with metadata.
        owner: The pool owner.
        id: The ID of the pool. Read-only field.
        status: The status of the pool. Read-only field.
        last_close_reason: A reason why the pool was closed last time. Read-only field.
        created: The UTC date and time when the pool was created. Read-only field.
        last_started: The UTC date and time when the pool was started last time. Read-only field.
        last_stopped: The UTC date and time when the pool was stopped last time. Read-only field.
        type: The type of the pool. Deprecated.

        Creating a new pool.

    Toloker's access to projects or pools can be restricted.
    You can set the duration of the ban or apply an unlimited restriction.

    Use the [set_user_restriction](toloka.client.TolokaClient.set_user_restriction.md) method to apply a restriction
    and the [delete_user_restriction](toloka.client.TolokaClient.delete_user_restriction.md) method to remove it.

    Attributes:
        id: The ID of the restriction.
        user_id: The ID of the Toloker.
        private_comment: A comment visible to the requester only.
        will_expire: The UTC date and time when the access will be restored by Toloka.
            If the parameter isn't set, then the restriction is active until you remove it calling the `delete_user_restriction` method.
        created: The UTC date and time when the restriction was applied. Read-only field.

    Example:
        Restricting access to a project and removing the restriction.

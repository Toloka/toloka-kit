    Quality control lets you get more accurate responses and restrict access to tasks for cheating performers.
    Quality control consists of rules. All rules work independently.

    Attributes:
        training_requirement: Parameters of the training pool that is linked to the pool with the main tasks.
        captcha_frequency: Frequency of captcha display (By default, captcha is not shown):
            LOW - show every 20 tasks.
            MEDIUM, HIGH - show every 10 tasks.
        configs: List of quality control units. See QualityControl.QualityControlConfig
        checkpoints_config: Random check majority opinion. Datailed description in QualityControl.CheckpointsConfig.

    Example:
        How to set up quality control on new pool.

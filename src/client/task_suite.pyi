    TaskSuite can contain one or more tasks. The execution price is charged for one TaskSuite.
    Performers receive exactly one TaskSuite when they take on your task.

        pool_id: The ID of the pool that task suite are uploaded to.
        tasks: Data for the tasks.

        issuing_order_override: The priority of a task suite among other sets in the pool. Defines the order in which
            task suites are assigned to performers. The larger the parameter value, the higher the priority.
            This parameter can be used if the pool has issue_task_suites_in_creation_order: true.

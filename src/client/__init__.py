class TolokaClient:
    """Implements interaction with the Toloka API

    All other objects are created or modified only in the memory of your computer.
    Only by calling one of the TolokaClient methods, you can transfer information from these objects to Toloka.
    For Example. If you create an instance of Project, it will not create such a project in Toloka. You need to call the
    TolokaClient.create_project method and pass the project instance there.
    Likewise. If you read the project using the TolokaClient.get_project method, you will get an instance of Project.
    But if you change something in this object, it will not affect the existing project in Toloka. To apply these changes,
    call TolokaClient.update_project and pass the changed Project there.

    Args:
        token: You OAuth token for Toloka. You can learn more about how to get it here: https://yandex.ru/dev/toloka/doc/concepts/access.html?lang=en
        environment: There are two versions of Toloka. You need to register separately in each of them:
            * SANDBOX: Testing version oif Toloka. You can test complex projects before the start. Nobody saw your tasks.
            * PRODUCTION: Production version of Toloka for requesters. You spend money and get result.
        retries: Retry policy. You can use the following types:
            * int - The number of retries for all requests. In this case, the retry policy is created automatically.
            * Retry - Fully specified retry policy that will apply to all requests.
        timeout: Same as timeout in Requests. The connect timeout is the number of seconds Requests will wait for your client
            to establish a connection to a remote machine call on the socket.
            * If you specify a single value for the timeout, it will be applied to both the connect and the read timeouts.
            * Specify a tuple if you would like to set the values separately.
            * Set the timeout value to None if you're willing to wait forever.
        url: If you want to set a specific URL for some reason, for example, for testing.
            You can only set one parameter, "url" or "environment", not both.

    Example:
        How to create TolokaClient and make you first request to Toloka.

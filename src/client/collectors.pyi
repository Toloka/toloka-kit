    If you or the system banned a performer and you want someone else to complete their tasks.
    This rule will help you do this automatically.

    Used with conditions:
        * PoolAccessRevokedReason - Reason for loss of access of the performer to the current pool.
        * SkillId - The performer no longer meets the specific skill filter.

    Used with actions:
        * ChangeOverlap - Increase the overlap of the set of tasks.

    Example:
        How to resend rejected assignments for re-completion to other performers.

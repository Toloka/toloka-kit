# Toloka-kit usage examples
## _Data collection, markup, aggregation, and other applications_

Why it may be usefull:
- Easily reuse projects by just copying and pasting code. No need to configure parameters in the interface over and over again.
- Train your ML models and run your data labeling projects in the same environment.
- Take advantage of open-source code that anyone can use and contribute to.

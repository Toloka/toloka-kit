0	!!! is an American band formed in the fall of 1996 by the merger of members of the groups Black Liquorice and Popesmashers. After a successful joint tour, the two bands decided to mix the disco-funk with more aggressive sounds and integrate the hardcore singer Nic Offer from the Yah Mos. The band's name was inspired by the subtitles of the movie The Gods Must Be Crazy, in which the clicking sounds of the San people's Juǀʼhoan language were represented as "!". However, as the bandmembers themselves say, !!! is pronounced by repeating thrice any monosyllabic sound. "Chk Chk Chk" is the most common pronunciation, and the URL of their official website and the title of their Myspace page suggest it is the preferred pronunciation.
1	!Action Pact! was from Stanwell in Middlesex, and was also originally named Bad Samaritans. In 1981 they changed their name to !Action Pact!. The John from Dead Mans Shadow (D.M.S.) was Bad Samaritan's original lead singer, and he left to concentrate on D.M.S., before the name change.  He was replaced by George Cheex, who got the job because of "her courage to scream along with the band's songs."  They contributed two songs to the EP Heathrow Touchdown which was released in October, 1981, while George and Joe were still only 15 years old. "London Bouncers" and "All Purpose Action Footwear", got the attention of BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel.  He played their songs often and he convinced the band to record their first full session, which they did on 22 February 1982. They recorded "People", "Suicide Bag", "Mindless Aggression", "Losers", and "Cowslick Blues". The resulting demo tape caught the attention of the fledgling label Fall Out Records, which signed the band as the first act on its roster.  !Action Pact!'s label debut, the Suicide Bag EP, was released in July 1982 and rocketed to the top of the British punk chart.
2	!HERO is a rock opera modernizing Jesus's last two years of life, as narrated in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City, in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations (ICON). Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N., nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out, except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently, New York City is a police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small, isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions, only Judaism survives and flourishes, at least, as much as it can.
3	In Bethlehem, PA, a child named Jesus, but referred to as HERO, is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City, teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes HERO is a threat, and the Chief of police Devlin (a derivative of the Devil or Satan), with the help of chief Rabbi Kai (Caiaphas), conspire to end HERO's revolutionary teachings.
4	!Kweiten-ta-||Ken (also known as Rachel or Griet) was a noted |xam (San) chronicler of xam culture and knowledge. She played an important role in contributing to the Bleek and Lloyd archive of “Bushman Folklore” providing a female perspective on the life, rituals, and beliefs of |xam society. She was the primary source on |xam folklore, customs, and coming-of-age rights. She travelled to the Cape in June 1874 with her family and stayed until January 1875 during which she was interviewed by Wilhelm Bleek and Lucy Lloyd. She was from the Katkop mountains north west of Brandvlei in what is today South Africa.
5	THEE PAUSE is originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and currently based in the New York City area. He has been previously selected by MTV & 495 Productions with other DJs to perform internationally for thousands. Having been selected to perform with and remix multiple platinum selling artists, he has been featured as a guest curator for Trance Mix. He has been featured, interviewed or reviewed by Spin (France), Scotch & Murder Monthly, More Than Disco, Hot Biscuits, The Atlantic Monthly, Trip Hop Daily, Creme de le Creme, reverb, Music Under Fire, and Fahrenheit, and has multiple top-charting tracks and remixes on The Hype Machine and Beatport. THEE PAUSE was selected in February 2012 as a featured DJ for W Hotels Worldwide and a commissioned mix was made available exclusively on W Hotels Worldwide by Starwood Hotels and Resorts iPhone application.
6	In March 2013, THEE PAUSE joined forces with Scott Putesky, former lead guitarist and co-founder of the band Marilyn Manson, to form "The Daisy Kids". The Daisy Kids was an American hard rock group consisting of former Marilyn Manson guitarist Daisy Berkowitz and producer, multi-instrumentalist and bass player THEE PAUSE. Guest vocals on the Mr Conrad Samsung EP were provided by Justin Symbol of Nursing Home fame[2]. Numerous rough demos were recorded, including a yet to circulate four-song CD entitled The Samsung Sessions. That four-song CD/demo was shelved due to legal issues regarding the use of uncleared samples, and only one track from those recording sessions has surfaced to date.
7	Lynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists, curators, critics, and historians for over 4 decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in a variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as a result. The movie begins with a scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where Hershman asks people to name 3 women artists; very few can name more than Frida Khalo. Hershman calls the film the, "remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told." She says the events of the day led her to feel an, "urgency to capture that moment" and shoot whenever, wherever with a borrowed camera.
8	The film gets its name from Women Artists in Revolution (WAR), which formed in the 1960s as a coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at a fundamental level, Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie, with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was, sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time.
9	Richard Knight for the Windy City Times has a more critical view of the film, explaining, "Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown, demanding parity with their male counterparts. However, by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists didn't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts, the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own – just like those 'womyn only' coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day'. So, while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries – and annoyingly overlooks the artist's feminist forebears (like O'Keeffe, Nevelson and Kahlo, for example) – !Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone."
10	!Wowow! began in the back of the Joiners Arms in Camberwell in 2003 as a performance night in a pub by Hanna Hanra and Matthew Stone. In 2004, the collective squatted a large Victorian co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an artist-run space. They include fashion designer Gareth Pugh, performance artist Millie Brown, video installation artist Adham Faramawy, James Balmforth and artist Matthew Stone. Other artists to have shown in the space include Boo Saville, Gareth Cadwallader, Florence & The Machine's Isabella Summers and Ellie Tobin.
11	The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings, film, photography and performance by recent Slade graduates for a month in the Georgian building at 251 Rye Lane, Peckham, formerly occupied by the Co-op shop, which the artists gutted and refurbished. The artists, who curated the exhibition together, included Chloe Dewe Mathews with photographs of lidos, Matthew Stone with digital recreations of old paintings, Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and biro drawings. The opening featured shamanistic chanting, a shopping Trolley Mardi Gras, live bands and a recreation of Michael Jackson's video Thriller by performance artist Lali Chetwynd's troupe.
12	In November 2005, the Children of !Wowow! organised a week-long event in a large warehouse in Peckham, curated by member Gareth Cadwallader, and in a number of smaller venues in the area, featuring members of the collective and also Mark McGowan. Events included Stolen Cinema with cult films from a local rental shop, Richard Elms' play Factory Dog, and a Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown. he week culminated with a party for 1,500 people, with 10,000 bottles of beer, 500 bottles of whiskey, and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew, Ludes, The Long Blondes, and Ivich Lives.
13	In January 2019, Trippie Redd announced that he had two more projects to be released soon in an Instagram live stream, his second studio album, Immortal and Mobile Suit Pussy, which was reportedly set to be his fourth commercial mixtape, but it then became scrapped. He explained that Immortal would have tracks where deep and romantic concepts are present, while Mobile Suit Pussy would have contained tracks that are "bangers". Later in March 2019 in another Instagram live stream, Redd stated that his second album had "shifted and changed" and was no longer titled Immortal. He later revealed that the album would be titled !, and inspired by former collaborator XXXTentacion's ? album.
14	Rachel Aroesti of The Guardian described the album as "compelling but contradictory emo-rap", noting lyrical contradictions and concluding it "is doubtless part of the genre's forward march – but it's hard to get past the sense that White has sacrificed a coherent artistic identity in the name of progress." Writing for Pitchfork, Andy O'Connor wrote that the "songs touch on being true to oneself at all costs, but these half-baked lessons land flat since Redd himself doesn't really have an identity, musical or otherwise", further commenting, "Most of what happens here couldn't even realistically be considered rapping", calling the verses "dull and unimaginative on top of being restrictive in form" and "nonsense bars". O'Connor concluded that "the most enjoyable moments feel like controlled chaos. Redd [...] does at least sound more composed. That's to his credit as a person but it's not to his advantage as an artist."
15	The novel, which looks at the club as it changes throughout the years, spans decades in the lives of the women involved in the club, between 1868 and 1932. Many characters are introduced in the course of the novel, but the primary characters are Anne Gordon and Sally Rausch, who in 1868 are new graduates of the Waynesboro Female College. They marry soon after the opening of the book, and the decades that follow chronicle their marriages and those of their children and grandchildren. Santmyer focuses not just on the lives of the women in the club, but also their families, friends, politics, and developments in their small town and the larger world.
16	On the day of their graduation from the Waynesboro Female College in 1868, best friends Anne Alexander and Sarah "Sally" Cochran are invited along with several of the college's female teachers by Mrs. Lowrey, who along with her professor husband operates the college, to become founding members of a new local society, the Waynesboro Woman's Club. The club is intended to promote culture and literature among the educated citizens of the Ohio town, while avoiding controversial subjects such as women's suffrage and other reform movements. Socially ambitious Sally agrees to join because she believes the club might become important in the town, and wants to establish herself as a serious-minded member of adult society. Introspective Anne, the class valedictorian, joins in order to support Sally. Other early members of the Club include Miss Louisa Tucker, a beautiful but cold mathematics teacher who later marries the commencement speaker General Deming; scholarly Amanda Reid, who overcame a poor background to earn a degree from Oberlin and has returned to teach at the Female College; Miss Agatha Pinney, an elderly teacher whose sciatica leads to a secret addiction to the laudanum she is prescribed; Mary, Thomasina and Eliza Ballard, the wife and daughters of a prominent local judge; and the Misses Gardiner, two reclusive spinsters whose nephew, Douglas, attends Princeton and becomes a local attorney and judge.
17	The club's membership grows over time to include the daughters, granddaughters, and other relatives of the early members, and other society women, particularly the wives of the town's numerous and often-changing Protestant ministers. Although the club itself is framed as non-controversial, club meetings and social events sponsored by its members often lead to discussions and conflicts stemming from the widely varying social and political views of the members and their families on subjects such as race, class, ethnic and religious biases, women's rights, labor reform, and the morality of drinking alcohol, attending the theater and celebrating Christmas.
18	Anne, the daughter of a doctor, is in love with Dr. John "Dock" Gordon, her father's protege and a friend of her late brother Rob who was killed in the Civil War. Depressed by his war experiences, John gave up his medical practice for several years, but with Anne's encouragement resumes his practice and the two marry. Anne's father consents to the match, but warns her that John is too affected by the suffering he sees as a doctor and that he is likely to make a poor husband, so Anne will have to be very tolerant. Sally develops a relationship with John's friend Captain Ludwig Rausch, who has bought a small local rope-making business and begun building it into a large, updated factory. Although Ludwig is a German immigrant, his ambitions match Sally's and her banker father, approving of his work ethic and prospects, agrees to their marriage. Thomasina Ballard also makes an unexpected marriage to a church organist as a result of a wedding poem she wrote for Anne.
19	Over the years, Anne and Sally continue their club activities while raising families.  Anne and John have a son, Johnny, and a daughter, Binny; Sally and Ludwig have a daughter, Elsa, and several sons. Although John is an intelligent and caring doctor, he is secretly unfaithful to Anne as a way of relieving the pressure of his past war memories and current responsibilities. Anne eventually finds out, and suspects that John has even fathered a child with his cousin Jessamine Stevens in New Orleans. Although deeply hurt by John's behavior, Anne, remembering her father's advice, chooses to overlook it and even welcomes Jessamine and her son when they later move to Waynesboro. Meanwhile, Ludwig becomes a successful industrialist and Sally a prominent local hostess, later taking over the presidency of the club.
20	Ludwig hires Eliza Ballard as his secretary after she is forced to leave her previous position in her late father's former law firm due to gossiping about partner Doug Gardiner's romance with an Irish Catholic girl whom he later marries. Despite Eliza's gossip and sharp tongue occasionally causing trouble in the town, she shows a softer side by caring for Ariana McCune, a terminally ill young girl who ran away from her oppressively religious parents. Miss Pinney's laudanum addiction eventually becomes public knowledge after she appears increasingly disheveled and unable to control her primary school class. At the instigation of Louisa Deming, Miss Pinney is forced to retire on a small pension and her laudanum supply is cut off. Embarrassed and suffering severe withdrawal, she dies of a heart attack while trying to burn herself to death.
21	Elsa secretly loves her childhood friend Johnny, but Johnny falls in love with the Demings' daughter Julia, who like her mother is beautiful but cold. Julia is more affectionate towards Johnny's younger sister Binny, who is dazzled by Julia's beauty. Binny gathers violets on a cold damp morning to make Julia a May basket, and is rewarded by a kiss from Julia, but the dampness brings on an attack of rheumatic fever and Binny dies. Johnny and Julia marry and have a son, Tucker, while Elsa marries Gib Evans and has a daughter, Jennifer, who becomes Tucker's close friend. Shortly after the turn of the century, Anne is widowed when John has an accident rushing to help a patient in bad weather, and subsequently dies of pneumonia.
22	Julia's frigidity causes Johnny to have an affair with his Irish Catholic nurse, Norah O'Neill. Through Johnny, Norah's younger sister Ellen meets Ludwig and Sally's youngest son Paul.  Ellen and Paul have a secret romance and Ellen becomes pregnant, resulting in Paul quietly marrying her with Ludwig's consent since he is underage.  Although Paul and Ellen are happy, Sally disapproves of the marriage, cuts ties with her son and, in response to a barbed remark by Julia's mother Louisa, informs her about Johnny's affair with Norah. As a result, Julia divorces Johnny, moves to California with Tucker, and later marries a wealthy older man who is past the age of having sex. Johnny, suffering from heart disease and the strain of the divorce, soon dies. Anne and the other members of the club are unaware that Sally was the one who revealed Johnny's affair to Louisa, and instead think Eliza spread the story. Sally eventually is reconciled with Paul after he and his family survive a devastating flood.
23	Ludwig dies and his daughter Elsa takes over as president of the family-owned bank; she also succeeds her mother as president of the club. Elsa's son Ludwig takes control of his grandfather's company after returning from his service in the Great War, where he was gassed. Tucker, separated from Jennifer by his parents' divorce, meets her again as an adult when they are both serving in France in the war, he as a medical corpsman and she as a nurse. After the war, they marry, and Tucker becomes a doctor and returns to take up his practice in Waynesboro. By the 1930s, Sally is suffering from arteriosclerosis and asks Elsa to bring Anne so that she can confess to Anne that she was the one who revealed Johnny's affair. Elsa talks her out of doing so, noting that Anne is happy with the company of Tucker, Jennifer and their children. As a result, Sally has a farewell visit with Anne but does not mention the situation involving Johnny. Sally dies soon afterwards. In 1932, right after Franklin D. Roosevelt is elected president, Anne, the last surviving founding member of the club, dies and the Club commemorates the end of an era.
24	A collection of her nostalgic reminiscences of Xenia, Ohio was published as Ohio Town by Ohio State University Press in 1962.  The director of the Press, Weldon Kefauver, encouraged her to write more.  In 1976 she submitted eleven boxes containing bookkeeping ledgers, her manuscript of Ladies in longhand.  Kefauver accepted the novel, but wanted it trimmed.  By then, Santmyer was spending much of her time in a nursing home and she dictated changes to her friend Mildred Sandoe.  The Press published the novel, printed 1500 copies and sold a few hundred, priced at $35, mostly to libraries.  In 1983, Santmyer was forced for health reasons to move permanently into a nursing home.
25	One local library patron, in returning the book, told the librarian that it was the greatest novel she had ever read. Another patron, Grace Sindell, overheard this and checked the book out herself. After reading it, she agreed with the assessment and called her son Gerald in Hollywood. He was at first reluctant to look at the book, believing that anything that was that good would already be taken. Unable to find a copy in California, he ordered one directly from the publisher and agreed that it had great potential. He convinced his Hollywood friend Stanley Corwin of the same and the two purchased movie, TV and republication rights. They then convinced Putnam to republish the book. Before republication, the Book-of-the-Month club chose Ladies as their main selection. Suddenly, Santmyer and her novel were a media sensation, including front-page coverage in the New York Times.
26	The "90th Anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan (1918–2008)" Medal (Azerbaijani: "Azərbaycan Respublikası Silahlı Qüvvələrinin 90 illiyi (1918–2008)" medalı) is a commemorative medal of Azerbaijan issued to denote the 90th anniversary of the formation of the Armed Forces of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in 1918. It was established in accordance with the decree of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev on May 16, 2008. Eligible personnel include warrant officers and ensigns who succeeded in combat training while serving in the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan until June 26, 2008, as well as retired officers who actively participated in the formation and strengthening of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
27	The American Defense Service Medal was the first military award to use the "A" device which was named the "Atlantic Device" (sometimes was referred to as the "Axis Device"). The "A" device was authorized for wear (in lieu of a 3⁄16 inch bronze star that was worn in lieu of a service clasp on the award) on the medal and service ribbon by any member of the United States Navy, United States Marine Corps, or United States Coast Guard who served on certain vessels in the Atlantic Ocean between June 22 and December 7, 1941 which engaged in armed conflict, or potential armed conflict, with Axis forces in the Atlantic (naval forces of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine). Such personnel were awarded the American Defense Service Medal with the "Atlantic Device" (Atlantic Fleet service), the intent being to recognize those who had participated in the "undeclared war" when the U.S. was assisting Britain with war convoys and German U-boat interdiction.
28	As of February 8, 2007, only those airmen (Air Force active, Reserve, or Guard) who were assigned to Thule Air Base (north-east Greenland) qualify for the "A" (Arctic) device. Although portions of Alaska are within the Arctic Circle, there are no American military bases within that region. The "A" is worn on the center of the ribbon except when worn with oak leaf clusters. Whenever oak leaf clusters are authorized for wear on the ribbon, the "A" is placed to the wearer's right of the oak leaf clusters on the ribbon. Only one "A" device may be worn on the ribbon.
29	Kinsey Millhone, 32, private detective investigates the death of prominent divorce lawyer Laurence Fife. His murder eight years earlier was blamed on his wife, Nikki Fife. Upon being released from prison, Nikki hires Kinsey to find the real murderer. In the course of the investigation, Kinsey becomes involved with Charlie Scorsoni, the late Mr. Fife's former law partner. She discovers Fife's death has been linked to that of a woman in Los Angeles, his law firm's accountant; both died after taking poisonous oleander capsules, which had been substituted for allergy pills. Kinsey tracks down the accountant's parents and former boyfriend. She then goes to Las Vegas to interview Fife's former secretary, Sharon Napier, who is killed minutes before Kinsey arrives. Back in California, Kinsey is mystified that Nikki's son, Colin, recognizes Laurence's first wife, Gwen, in a photograph. Kinsey surmises that Gwen was having an affair with her ex-husband at the time of his death. She accuses Gwen, who confesses. Shortly afterwards, she too is dead, killed in a hit-and-run crash.
30	Kinsey has solved the case she was hired to investigate; but in a plot twist, she discovers that her previous notions about the accountant's death were entirely wrong: in fact, it was Scorsoni who killed her when she discovered he was skimming dividend money from estate accounts under his management. Scorsoni used the same method that Gwen used to kill Fife, so it would be assumed the same person committed both murders. In a final confrontation, he chases Kinsey across the beach, armed with a knife. Kinsey hides in the shore line, and she is forced to remove her shoes and pants. Before Scorsoni can kill her, she shoots him dead.
31	Looking back at the series soon after the author's death, Library Journal Reviews remarked on the slow build up to successful reviews, including a quote from its own review: "Critic Sarah Weinman notes that pseudonymous New York Times critic Newgate Callendar dismissed A Is for Alibi as "competent enough, but not particularly original." Alas, LJ's reviewer was equally unenthusiastic in an April 1, 1982, review, waving the book aside as "nothing to take it out of the ordinary." Before those less enthusiastic words, they had said, "The female detective is well drawn and the plot moves at a fast clip".
32	The "All God's Children" Campaign is an effort by the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) to challenge religious opposition to the legalization of same-sex marriage and promote LGBT acceptance in the Southern United States. According to the HRC, the program was designed to "change hearts and minds, improve the public perception and overall awareness of LGBT people, begin to reduce the painful stigma that many face in their daily lives, and help future efforts to enact pro-equality legislation." The program targeted Mississippi, Alabama, and Arkansas – all states that had no form of housing, employment, or marriage protections for LGBT citizens.
33	The Southern United States is far more culturally conservative than the North. In the early 2000s, while northern states began legalizing same-sex marriage, many southern states were passing laws banning it. However, southern support as a whole rose an entire 26 percentage points from 2003 to 2013, leaving the south currently split about evenly on the issue of same-sex marriage. Scholars suggest that some of the factors leading to this cultural change include generational differences, the "friends and family effect," and a new appreciation for the separation of church and state. Approximately 64% of Southerners can say that they know someone who is gay or lesbian, a factor that is considered crucial for support of legislation such as same-sex marriage.
34	The South also holds the lowest regional social climate index ranking for the LGBT community in the United States, with a score of 55.. Same-sex couples with kids have a household income that averages about $11,000 lower than heterosexual couples. Gay and bisexual men in the south hold higher HIV infection rates than those in other parts of the country; additionally, only 3⁄475% of southern LGBT people are covered by health insurance. "Discomfort" with exposure to LGBT lifestyles, such as attending a same-sex wedding or seeing pictures of a coworker with a same-sex partner, polls about 5-10 percentage points higher in the South than in northern states.
35	The term originated in the United Kingdom and was first noted during Iain Duncan Smith's leadership of the Conservative Party from 2001 to 2003. It has been subsequently popularised by former Conservative Party aide Tim Montgomerie, the former editor of ConservativeHome, who has written on its usage. It has also been used in the United States where it has been picked up by publications such as The Weekly Standard that considered its implications for the Republican Party. The term has been defined in the United States by The Oklahoma Gazette as follows: 
36	Soo voer gesongen, soo na gepepen is a c.1668–1670 oil-on-canvas painting (H 133.7 cm × W 162.5 cm) by Dutch artist Jan Steen, that is currently featured in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague. The painting is a celebratory holiday scene that depicts three generations of a Dutch family, and serves as an allegory about parental examples, vice, and influence. This subject has been painted thirteen times by Jan Steen and has also been known as The Cat Family, or Jan Steen's Family. Of the many renditions, the Mauritshuis version is considered to be the exemplar of the series.
37	The holiday scene depicts the proverb of "As the Old Sing, So Pipe the Young" and deliberately alludes to the fact the elders in a family have certain traits that recur in subsequent generations. Inherited traits were viewed by the Dutch people at the time as being a two-sided coin, where a child would inherit genetic traits from their parents, but would also learn to emulate the behaviors that they witnessed. This is also referred to as nature versus nurture. The depiction of three generations of family members in this scene is a direct allusion to this idea, with the parents providing seemingly poor examples to their children by drinking alcoholic beverages and encouraging the children to smoke. The title can also be interpreted as "Like father, like son."  Such proverbs were popular in Dutch painting and are represented by many paintings by Steen and other artists. This painting has been linked to Steen's work titled The Twelfth Night Feast, the two paintings forming a diptych of the same theme. The theme is thought to be inspired by Jacob Jordaens, a contemporary Flemish painter. Jordaen's version preceded Steen's, having been painted in the year 1683. Like Jordaens, Steen paired proverbs with merry company paintings, which was popular and served a didactic purpose for the viewer.
38	As a genre scene, the painting contains many iconographic elements that are open to the viewer's interpretation and ideas that relate to Dutch popular culture of the time. The painting consists of a gathering of family members (parents, children, grandparents) around a table that is draped with a carpet typical of Dutch scenes. Though the subject has been painted by Steen an estimated thirteen times, each one was depicted in a household setting as the theme for child rearing and parental interaction. Like most of Steen's paintings As the Old Sing... is of the merry company genre and depicts family life as a part of popular culture during the 17th century. Paintings of this particular period are commonly festive scenes in Dutch domestic settings. The large canvas displays Steen's mastery of painting light on surfaces, as can be seen in the treatment of light from the window reflected onto the surfaces of the models' clothing and furniture accents. The facial features of the subjects are painted in a realistic style with attention to light and shadow. The overall scene of the merry atmosphere is thought to be open and inviting with the figures situated in an open arrangement, with warm colors of orange, pink, purple, and brown; while casually enjoying themselves. The old lady in the foreground, thought to be Steen's mother, is holding a sheet of music that is open and can be easily read by the viewer. Steen is distinguished as a skilled comic painter and for depicting himself in his paintings, as well as members of his own family. Here he has depicted himself as the father seen in the right side of the canvas who is teaching his younger son to smoke a pipe. Such a painting was thought by the artist to have universal appeal and understanding, but of course, it would have had more resonance with a well-read person familiar with the proverbs, symbolism, and culture of the seventeenth century. Ironically, Steen's knowledge of such readings and traditions is considered to be rather sophisticated.
39	The figures in the scene are Steen at the right wearing a black hat and teaching his younger son to smoke, his older son playing a bagpipe, a young girl at the far right edge of the canvas, Steen's mother in the right-side foreground, and an unknown female family member holding a baby. There is also a male servant at the rear center who is pouring an alcoholic drink into the glass of Steen's wife, who is pictured at the left of the canvas wearing a green coat and lavender skirt with her glass outstretched. There is a dog in the foreground. At the center of the table is an oyster which has been a popular symbol in Dutch genre painting. The oyster has been known as a symbol of Aphrodite, love, fertility, and sexual pleasure. The symbol is befitting of such as scene as it is associated with foods served at a feast of the gods. The oyster was commonly depicted in Dutch genre paintings up until the year 1635 when it became less common. After the year 1660 the symbol again became a common theme as it is here in Steen's 1668–1670 painting. In the painting the woman in the lavender skirt sitting at the left is a depiction of Steen's wife. She and Steen both wear a pink ribbon, she in her hair, and he on his hat. This ribbon is a unifying element between the two and represents their being cut from the same spool of ribbon. The parrot situated at the top left of the painting is a symbol of mimicry. To the left of the parrot is a pair of birds in a small birdcage which symbolizes two parents in a small abode. The pipe in the scene may have multiple meanings referring to a clay smoking pipe, the act of singing, or to a drinking vessel.According to the Dutch, the bagpipe was not an esteemed instrument as it was thought to be lowly and obnoxious. Such a symbol here represents bawdiness and low class, which is being encouraged by the parents. The young man playing the bagpipe is an older son of Steen. The laughing face of Jan Steen is commonly depicted by the artist in his paintings and is considered to be his iconography while laughter is also thought to be a symbol of foolishness and or fault. A reader might interpret the many laughing faces as gained wisdom, human fault, or lessons learned. Steen's iconographic grin has become somewhat of a folk character to museum patrons who delight in seeing his face in paintings.
40	Steen has been detailed by historians as being from a middle-class, Catholic family of Leiden, who was also preoccupied with drinking and imprudent of his finances. Historical accounts state that Steen's father owned a brewery but also suggest that the brewery business became less profitable due to economic demands and competition. As a result, Steen was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in painting, which was a respected profession of the time. From his experience as a painter Steen endured constant fluctuations of financial difficulty. As a painter he often depicted himself within his comical scenes to show himself immersed in the culture he depicted and is also as an allusion to the idea that art imitates life. Steen was a resident of The Hague where he married Margariet or Grietje, and also became a member of The Hague Guild. As a member of the guild Steen is thought to have pursued comic painting as the path to a chosen specialization.
41	On June 17, 2016, after a hiatus from social media, Glover tweeted "pharos.earth", a link to download his new app. The app itself placed the user in outer space looking at a small blue planet while a clock counted down to zero. The app then had the user crash down from space, placing them on a map that was located on Joshua Tree, California. The app then showed the dates of his upcoming performances in Joshua Tree, where the user could also purchase tickets. The concert festival was to debut the album and give the audience the "full-album experience". From September 3 to 5, nearly three months before the release of his album, Glover held three concert performances at Joshua Tree to debut the album. Glover wore glow-in-the-dark paint on his braids and a pink and yellow skirt, with his bandmates wearing similar attire. He performed eleven songs during the concert with minimal rapping, mainly featuring a funk/jazz vibe.
42	Mosi Reeves of Rolling Stone wrote that ""Awaken, My Love!" is an enthralling trip into the land of funk", while Dan Bogosian from The A.V. Club wrote "Is Childish Gambino suddenly the new Prince, a virtuoso multi-instrumentalist always ready to keep the world an arm’s length away from knowing what he's thinking? Is he D'Angelo, a soul god fighting against his first image with all-time great music? No. He is Donald Glover, a man who can perform and write comedy, act in drama, and drop a truly wonderful album on short notice with all the influences and instructions spelled out". Perry Kostidakis of the FSView & Florida Flambeau wrote that "with each successive album, Childish Gambino has exhibited phenomenal growth, but no more than on his latest release. Unflinchingly ambitious and boldly different, "Awaken, My Love" calls back the sounds and themes of the 1970s funkadelic movement to provide a wholly original, emotional and immersive musical experience", with The Guardian's Gwilym Mumford adding "only the limitations of his voice occasionally let him down – he doesn't quite have the range to nail Awaken's more ostentatious vocal lines. Still, it's a minor gripe when there's so much here to enjoy". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said, "It's at once a homage and a parody, equally aware of that era's excesses and its glories, of the way that the most memorable 1970s R&B merged sensuality, activism, humor, toughness, outlandishness, futurism, soul roots, wild eccentricity and utopian community spirit. That's an extremely high bar, but at its best, "Awaken, My Love!" recalls many of those virtues". Tim Sendra of AllMusic said, ""Awaken, My Love!" is a stone-cold blast from beginning to end".
43	Matthew Strauss of Pitchfork said, "There are times, however, when that nodding feels more like mimicry than anything else. Maybe he'll figure out how to smuggle Donald Glover's heart into Childish Gambino's brain eventually, but if he hasn't figured out what he wants out of Childish Gambino yet, it's increasingly rewarding watching him try". Scott Glaysher of XXL said, "Childish Gambino gets definite props for pushing the envelope and refusing to operate within any genre confinements on this refreshing 49-minute trip through the funkadelic 1970s. While these blurred lines make this album a little hard to follow, "Awaken, My Love!" proves his versatility as a rapper turning over a new leaf". Kitty Empire of The Observer said, "Throughout, Glover's genre fluency is unimpeachable; the only minor drawback is the overmannered air of some of these period pieces, where there could be more straight-up abandon, as on the persuasive 'Me and Your Mama'". Vice negatively described the album as "pure Funkadelic cosplay". Critic Robert Christgau regarded the album as "a seriously overrated piece of romantic P-Funk retro that owes its Grammy nomination to Atlanta".
44	"Awaken, My Love!" debuted at number five on the US Billboard 200 with 101,000 album-equivalent units, marking the third highest debut of the week.  It was the fourth best-selling album of the week, selling 72,000 copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was also streamed 41.5 million times in the first week. It is Glover's highest-charting album. As of December 28, 2016, the album has sold 151,000 album-equivalent units, with 100,000 in physical album sales. On September 27, 2018, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales, streaming and track-sales equivalent of a million units in the United States.
45	Things are not as easy as they seem, however, as Millhone can find no trace of Elaine anywhere in Florida, although she does find a woman called Pat Usher, who claims Elaine agreed to let her sublet the Boca Raton apartment where Elaine lived while she was off travelling. This claim rings false, since no one but Pat Usher has received a postcard from Elaine on her supposed trip. Millhone secures the able assistance of Elaine's elderly neighbour, Julia, to keep an eye on things in Florida while she goes back to California. Millhone suspects there is a link between Elaine's disappearance and the death of her Santa Teresa neighbour, Marty Grice, who was apparently killed by a burglar who then set fire to the Grice home a week before Elaine left.  Someone breaks into the home of Tillie, the supervisor of Elaine's Santa Teresa apartment complex, apparently on the track of some of Elaine's bills that Tillie was holding ready to forward to her. Someone also searches the detective's apartment, and Millhone realizes the thief is after Elaine's passport.
46	Millhone is increasingly convinced that Elaine is dead and that Pat Usher is involved. Pat disappears after totally trashing the Boca Raton apartment. Eventually, Millhone discovers that Pat Usher has applied for a driving licence in Elaine's name, thus proving Pat's involvement.  Marty's nephew Mike, a teenage drug dealer, confesses that he was at the Grice home the night of the murder; and from the discrepancy in times between his account and what was told to the police, Kinsey realises that it was Elaine who died in the Grice fire, not Marty. Marty and her husband killed Elaine to steal her identity (which Marty assumed) and her money. They then passed Elaine's dead body off as Marty's by switching the dental records. Marty departed for Florida as Elaine and arrived as Pat Usher, with some cosmetic surgery to help. Unable to find Elaine's passport, she and her husband were forced to wait for a new one to come through before they can skip the country. Kinsey returns to the Grice home to look for the murder weapon; but while she is there, the Grices find her. Marty Grice is shot in the left arm during the fight that ensues, but Kinsey manages to detain the two criminals and calls for help.
47	"Babbacombe" Lee is a 1971 album by British folk rock group Fairport Convention, which tells the life story of John Babbacombe Lee, a   Victorian-era alleged murderer who was condemned to death but reprieved after the gallows failed on three occasions to work properly. After the commercial and chart success of its predecessor, Angel Delight, the album sold disappointingly, though it was critically acclaimed, and is regarded by the authors of The Electric Muse (1975) as the first "folk rock opera". It was the band's seventh album since their debut in 1968.
48	The album follows John "Babbacombe" Lee's life story. The events of his life are described in song, from his boyhood through his conviction for murder, sentence of death, and the failure to carry out the execution. The songs describe his boyhood poverty, his time in the Royal Navy, and his being invalided out. The album then describes how Lee went to work in the service of a Miss Keyes. While Lee was in her service, she was murdered, and he was accused, tried and convicted of the crime, and sentenced to death; however, when authorities attempted to hang him, the gallows failed three times, resulting in his release. These events are all told in song, and all but one of those songs are originals.
49	In November 1990, Lazaro Figueroa's body was discovered in front of a beach property in Miami Beach. He had been severely battered, which made it initially very difficult for authorities to identify him. Because Lazaro's remains were unidentified for weeks after his discovery, local news outlets nicknamed him "Baby Lollipops" in reference to the shirt he was found wearing.  The cause of death was later determined to be a blow to the head from a baseball bat. Trial evidence showed that shortly after leaving Lazaro's body in the bushes, the couple fled to Central Florida, even making a stop at Disney World.
50	Despite claims by neighbors and other individuals that Cardona was abusive towards Lazaro, she consistently denied it. Her main defense was that it was Olivia Gonzalez, her lover, who had beaten Lazaro and delivered the fatal blow with a baseball bat. Cardona attested that she wanted to escape the pain of her son's horrible beatings at her girlfriend's hands and so sank into cocaine use to cope. To support claims on the influence of her past in the case, her defense presented the court with evidence pertaining to her unsettled Cuban upbringing and the psychological devastation caused by the death of Lazaro's father. According to prosecutor Reid Rubin, however, Cardona was "angry and spiteful" from the death of her wealthy husband as she had lost a luxurious lifestyle.
51	Employees for the Florida Power & Light Company discovered Lazaro Figueroa's dead body on the morning of November 2, 1990 at Miami Beach, hidden beneath some bushes. The boy was so emaciated that he appeared skeletal, with a bruised right eye. He wore blue gym shorts over a soiled diaper wrapped multiple times with brown packaging tape. At the time of his murder, Lazaro's weight was 18 pounds (8.16 kg), half the weight of a healthy child his age. The t-shirt he was wearing caused the Miami Beach Police Department to name him “Baby Lollipops,” and he remained unidentified for weeks after his discovery.
52	The autopsy revealed that Lazaro had a fresh tear to his corpus callosum as the result of a head injury that occurred hours to days before he died. The police concluded that he died from a fractured skull, later known to be the result of a baseball bat blow. He was also starved and beaten, with a cigarette burn on his left cheek, broken teeth, broken bones, and bedsores from being bound to a mattress for extended periods.  His diaper was caked with excrement and attached to his body with brown packing tape, and his arm was permanently fixed at 90 degrees.
53	In the second trial, a mentally-handicapped 14-year-old girl, Gloria Pi from Miami Beach, provided a detailed confession of throwing Lazaro against a wall.  As a result, Cardona's legal defense team attempted to shift the blame of Lazaro's murder from Cardona to the girl.  During the trial, Pi retracted her confession and maintained that she was innocent, emphasizing that she had never cared for or met Lazaro when the defense posited that in the days leading up to his death, Pi was looking after him.  The jury requested that the confession be reread during their deliberation for the verdict.  However, the jurors discounted Pi's testimony because there was not enough evidence to suggest that Lazaro ever stayed at Pi's residence.  State prosecutor Kathleen Pautler described the confession as a "diversionary tactic" used by Cardona's defense team.
54	Miami-Dade jurors again found Cardona guilty of the two counts, and in 2011, she was sentenced to death a second time. In contrast to her outrage at the verdict in the 1992 trial, Cardona appeared collected when her sentence was handed down.  State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle stated, "Almost 20 years later, a second jury heard the evidence and has come to the same conclusion...The truth still remains the truth."  While reading her sentence, the judge, Reemberto Diaz stated, "Ana Maria Cardona, you have forfeited your right to live... Lazaro was tortured to death."
55	In her third trial in 2017, a neighbor testified, "She closed the door...it didn't appear that any lights were on but the shower was going and he was screaming." She stated that Lazaro was "very small, very thin, very frail." However, Cardona insisted under oath that she did not inflict significant abuse on her son or break any of his bones. She also continued to recant her 1990 statement that Lazaro fell off the bed and hit his head, causing the tear in his corpus callosum. Instead, she placed the blame on her ex-girlfriend Olivia Gonzalez, insisting that she struck Lazaro with a baseball bat. The defense said they would introduce evidence Gonzalez had confessed to hitting the boy with the baseball bat and killing him.
56	Cardona's elder son, a 37-year-old named Juan Puente, died while also in prison.  Puente, was serving a 10-year sentence for burglary, died at Gulf Correctional Institution’s Annex in February 2018.  While in jail in 2010, he was brought to a Miami courtroom to testify on his mother’s behalf in an effort to convince a jury to spare her life.  “The case followed him around, every time he got arrested. It was like a revolving door,” said Cardona’s former lawyer, Edith Georgi. “The kid had a really sweet way about him. He was very easy to get to know and friendly. But he had an addiction he couldn’t cure.”
57	Kristin Zahra Sands of the New York University Department of Middle Eastern Studies described the book as a Quranic exigesis rather than being an eternal study of exigesis. Barlas criticizes the traditional use of the hadith (sayings of Muhammed, not in the Quran) and tafsir (interpretation of the Quran), texts she sees as important to the misogynistic customs and beliefs in contemporary Islam, in Part I; these texts are often used together with the Qur'an in Islam.  She advocates using itjihad (informed independent thought). The author has criticized some English translations of the Qur'an, and she argued that the document may be explored in any language.
58	"Big Willie" Robinson (1942-2012) was an American street racer, bodybuilder, and president of the International and National Brotherhood of Street Racers. He was active in the street racing community in Los Angeles, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, where he gained attention of the Los Angeles Police Department, the local media, and politicians. The Watts riots led to Robinson using drag racing as a method of addressing street violence fueled by racial tensions and police violence. He married fellow street racer Tomiko Robinson in the late 1960s, who became an integral part of the street racing community until her death in 2007. With the support of Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, Robinson founded Brotherhood Raceway Park in 1974 and the dragstrip maintained a presence on Terminal Island until 1994. Robinson died in 2012.
59	Robinson was born and raised in New Orleans. He spent a year at Louisiana State University in 1960. Robinson recalled in 1994 how he came out of history class to find his 1953 Oldsmobile 98, a gift from his father, with its headlights and windows smashed and its tires slashed as the result of a racially motivated attack by a group of white people who were angry at the university's integration. He moved to Los Angeles in the early 1960s, where he attended UCLA. After financial difficulties following his parent's separation, he went to work at a local body shop before joining the street racing scene.
60	After the Watts riots of 1965, Robinson founded the International and National Brotherhood of Street Racers in 1968 with support from the LAPD, whose officers first attended his drag racing events in Compton, Inglewood, and Watts undercover. Paul Norwood, executive vice president of the organization stated that “there was a lot of tension and the police thought this was a good way for the people to get rid of their anxiety and anger by allowing them to do this on weekends.” The organization at its height grew to over 80,000 members in 38 states and 9 countries.
61	Support from Mayor Tom Bradley was instrumental in the opening of the organization's track in 1974, named Brotherhood Raceway Park. In 1977, Bradley commented: "It provides not only an opportunity to give these youngsters an outlet, but it helps build brotherhood. They are built upon the theme of brotherhood through street racing.” The track closed in 1984 but re-opened again in 1993, after Robinson persuaded the Los Angeles Harbor Commission to allow its reopening for two years. Some reports from officers indicate that crime dropped when the track was open. A retired deputy sheriff stated, “pretty much all the cops knew [that] when Willie’s track is open, it definitely makes a difference ... virtually all the street racing stopped because now they had a place to go.” In a 1994 article for Sports Illustrated, Robinson commented: "Black, white, yellow, brown, skinheads, Nazi party members, Muslims, we got 'em all. They're all here at the track, and they're communicatin'. And once they start communicatin', they start likin' each other, and once they start likin' each other, they forget about the hate." Robinson's mantra reportedly was If you're racing, you're not killing.
62	In 1919 the branch of the General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia in Latvia separated itself from the mother party and constituted a separate party of its own. After the conclusion of Latvian War of Independence, in the fall of 1920 a Central Bureau of the Latvian Bund was constituted. The Latvian Bund became an autonomous organization affiliated with the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party. The Bund had one seat in the Central Committee of the Latvian Social Democratic Workers Party. The Bund, as well as other left-wing groups in Latvia after the Latvian War of Independence, was under suspicion as Communist supporters. On June 20, 1921 the president of the party Abraham Braun "Sergei" (1881-1940) was sentenced to death by a military tribunal for spreading Communist propaganda but released after international socialist outcry over the sentence.
63	Born William Donaldson Dunham in New York City, Dunham wrote songs for the films of many major stars, including John Wayne ("McLintock!"), Randolph Scott ("Seven Men From Now"), and three Bob Hope films: Boy, Did I Get a Wrong Number!, I'll Take Sweden, and Alias Jesse James. He also wrote the lyrics to the theme song for the Flipper television series, and for the film,  The New Adventures of Flipper. His other films included The Young Swingers, Surf Party and Wild on the Beach,the last of which he also produced.
64	The novel begins with Kinsey at the gym, rehabilitating herself from injuries sustained at the end of B is for Burglar. While there, she meets Bobby Callahan, a twenty-three-year-old who was nearly killed when his car went off the road nine months ago. Bobby is convinced that the car crash, which killed his friend Rick, was an attempt on his life. He suspects that he may still be in danger, so he hires Kinsey to investigate. Having lost some of his memories and cognitive faculties as a result of the crash, he can only vaguely articulate why he thinks someone wants to kill him, referring to some information in a red address book that he can no longer locate.
65	Kinsey takes the case despite little information, having taken a liking to Bobby. She meets his rich but dysfunctional family: Glen, his mother is an heiress on her third marriage to Derek Wenner, whose daughter Kitty is a 17-year-old drug user and is seriously ill with anorexia. Glen has spared no expense in seeking treatment and counseling for Bobby. He is depressed further due to Rick's death, his own injuries, and the loss of his prospects at medical school. A few days later, Bobby dies in another car crash, which is attributed to a seizure while driving. Kinsey thinks this is the delayed result of the first crash and thus a successful murder. Kinsey investigates several people: Kitty stands to inherit 2 million dollars from Bobby's will; Derek insured Bobby's life for a large sum without Glen's knowledge; and Rick's parents blame Bobby for their son's death.
66	However, Kinsey looks elsewhere for the solution: a friend of Bobby's gives her Bobby's address book, which shows Bobby was searching for someone called Blackman. Bobby's former girlfriend thought Bobby ended their relationship because he was having an affair with someone else, and she thinks Bobby was helping a woman who was being blackmailed. Kinsey eventually finds out that the woman with whom Bobby was involved was his mother's friend, Nola Fraker. She confesses to having accidentally shot her husband, a well-known architect named Dwight Costigan, during a supposed struggle with an intruder at their home years prior. She has a blackmailer, who is in possession of the gun with Nola's fingerprints on it.
67	Trying to investigate further, Kinsey realizes that 'Blackman' is code for an unidentified corpse in the morgue. She finds the gun concealed in the corpse. However, while she is at the hospital, she finds the recently murdered body of the morgue assistant and realizes the killer is at the hospital. It is Nola's current husband, Dr. Fraker, a pathologist from the hospital, who is also the blackmailer. Bobby found out what Fraker was up to; but Fraker rigged the first car accident before he could do anything about it, leading Bobby to eventually put Kinsey on the trail. Soon after, Fraker cut Bobby's brake lines, leading to his fatal crash, and falsified the autopsy results to point to a seizure. Fraker traps Kinsey and gives her a disabling injection, but she manages to cosh him and escapes to a phone to call the police. In the epilogue, she describes finally discharging the debt she feels she owes to Bobby and concludes with a wish that he is at peace.
68	Adult males measure 26–31 mm (1.0–1.2 in) and adult females 35–44 mm (1.4–1.7 in) in snout–vent length. The snout is rounded in dorsal profile and truncated to slightly protruding when viewed laterally. The tympanum is indistinct and partly covered by the supra-tympanic fold. The fingers have absent to extensive webbing (from inner to outer fingers). The toes are extensively webbed. The dorsal surfaces of head, body, and limbs are olive green to grayish brown and bear large cream spots. The ventral parietal peritoneum is white. Adult males have a large humeral spine. The pre-pollical spine is not separated from the first finger. The iris is grayish brown and has dark reticulation.
69	Referencing Christian von Ehrenfels' distinction between cultural and natural sexual morality, Freud explains the etiological significance of cultural sexual morality as a reason for neurosis. At the beginning, Freud states that cultural sexual mores impose constraints on the individual, which can cause damage to the person, which in turn threatens the culture as a whole.  While von Ehrenfels argues primarily on the basis of Social Darwinism, saying social sexual morality may prevent male sexual selection in reproduction, Freud focuses on the consequences of socially-imposed repression of the sexual instinct as a cause of neurosis.
70	Culture is based on renunciation of drives. There is therefore a tension between a person's body, which seeks fulfilment of drives, and the demands of culture to renounce desire.  Those who cannot conform to these requirements imposed by society are either viewed as criminals and perverts - if they cannot fulfil society's demand for renunciation - or escape into neurosis when the drives are suppressed to such an extent that neurotic substitute pleasures are developed in their stead. Neurosis is thus the negative counterpart of perversion, "because they [neurotics] have the same appetites as the positive perverts in a 'repressed' state."
71	Freud said that the "perverse" part of the libido is caused by a disturbance in development. The libido was originally meant for deriving pleasure, not only at the genitals but also at other erogenous zones; but education has the purpose of limiting autoeroticism and directing love towards objects other than oneself, finally achieving the "primacy of genitals put into the service of procreation". Thus Freud was one of the first people who said that sexuality by itself does not generate any internal conflict, and explained that the conflict arises only through interaction with the outside world, with its social norms and its expectation of repression of instincts, which leads to disease (repression thesis). The suppressed perverse drives are ideally channeled through sublimation and harnessed for cultural work. The sex drive in humans is aperiodic and is divorced from reproduction. Therefore, it can be metonymically shifted and applied to other areas. Thus, culture benefits to a great extent - and is even dependent - on sexual energy that is redirected through sublimation. Therefore, Freud concluded that a complete renunciation of the sex drive is detrimental to culture. Abstinence only produces "brave weaklings", but not great thinkers with bold ideas. Freud thus describes the dilemma of culture, which simultaneously calls for renunciation while still needing the sexual instinct to preserve itself. The repression model that imposes cultural sexual morality should therefore be abandoned in favor of a sublimation, displacement, and distribution model of sexual energies.
72	"Colostethus" ruthveni is a species of frog in the family Dendrobatidae. It is endemic to the Magdalena Department in northern Colombia. The specific name ruthveni honors Alexander Grant Ruthven, an American herpetologist. It is known from the lower slopes of the north-western portion of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Its natural habitats are tropical dry forests and cloud forests where it occurs near streams, and is threatened by habitat loss. Males of this species on average have a snout-vent length of 18.9–20.1 millimetres (0.74–0.79 in) whereas females average about 19.8–24.1 millimetres (0.78–0.95 in).
73	John Mathis was born on September 28, 1930, in Maud, Texas. He played on Louisiana Hayride from 1951 to 1960, as a solo artist and as a member of the musical duo Jimmy & Johnny (with Jimmy Lee Fautheree). Mathis left the group to go solo in the middle of the 1950s, leaving Fautheree's brother, Lynn, to fill his shoes. Jimmy and Lynn, however, saved the name Jimmy & Johnny, which proved ideal for Mathis who returned to the group from 1959 to 1961. As a solo artist, he released several singles for D Records, Decca, United Artists, and Little Darlin'. His final charting single was "Please Talk to My Heart", released in 1963. He also encountered significant success as a songwriter, penning songs for Johnny Paycheck, George Jones, and Webb Pierce among others. For few decades, until the late 1990s, he sang gospel music and focused on his family.
74	"Crocodylus" affinis is an extinct species of crocodyloid from the Eocene of Wyoming. Fossils were first described from the Bridger Formation by American paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1871. Marsh described the species, along with every other species of crocodyloid in the Bridger Formation, under the genus Crocodylus. The known specimen of "Crocodylus" affinis is a skull found at Grizzly Buttes, Wyoming, measuring 13 inches in length on the upper surface. Recent phylogenetic studies of crocodyloids show that "C." affinis is not a species of Crocodylus, but a genus has not yet been erected to include the species. Other Bridger species such as Crocodylus clavis and Brachyuranochampsa zangerli have been synonymized with "C." affinis.
75	"C." megarhinus shares many features with living crocodiles like the Nile crocodile (C. niloticus), including a robust triangular skull that is shorter than most other crocodiles. Similarities are also seen in the teeth of the two species. Like living crocodiles, "C." megarhinus has several constricted areas along the upper jaw that provide spaces for the teeth of the lower jaw when the mouth is closed. The proportions of "C." megarhinus and C. niloticus are so similar that American paleontologist Charles C. Mook considered it "very probable that C. megarhinus is a direct ancestor of C. niloticus."
76	Kinsey Millhone receives a contract from ex-con Alvin Limardo to deliver a cashier's check for twenty-five thousand dollars to a fifteen-year-old boy named Tony Gahan. According to Limardo, Tony helped him through a tough time in his life, leaving Limardo indebted. However, when the retainer check Limardo made out to Kinsey for four hundred dollars bounces, she learns that Alvin Limardo is actually John Daggett, a man known by all and liked by few, and recently released from a local prison. He is also a bigamist. His first wife Essie's fanatical religious views have kept her married to Daggett, while Daggett, in disregard of his marital status, underwent a second marriage to Lovella on his release from prison, whom he has subjected to domestic abuse.
77	In her search to find Daggett and get her money back, Kinsey discovers that he was found dead on the beach only a few days after hiring her. Through Daggett's daughter Barbara, Kinsey learns that Tony Gahan was the sole survivor of a family killed in a car accident caused by Daggett, for which he received a conviction on charges of vehicular manslaughter. Tony's been a wreck since the death of his family, rarely sleeping and doing poorly in school. He now lives with his uncle and aunt, Ramona and Ferrin Westfall. Also killed in the accident was a friend of Tony's young sister, and a boy called Doug Polokowski, who had hitched a ride in the car. Kinsey tracks down an ex-con friend of Daggett's, Billy Polo, now living in a trailer park with his sister, Coral. Billy introduced Lovella to Daggett. Kinsey finds out that Doug Polokowski was Billy and Coral's brother. There's no shortage of people with a motive for Daggett's death, but the police are classifying it as an accident.
78	Kinsey discovers that shortly before his death, Daggett was staggering about drunk at the marina in the company of a blonde woman in a green outfit. Kinsey sets out to discover which of the numerous blonde women in the case might be the killer. She also suspects that Billy Polo is not giving her the full truth about his involvement with Daggett, a suspicion confirmed when Coral finally levels with Kinsey and reveals him to be blackmailing someone he suspects of Daggett's killing. The blackmailer murders Polo at the beach, using Kinsey's own gun, stolen from her car a few days earlier. Coral also admits to scheming with Billy and Lovella to rob Daggett of money he had come by illicitly in prison, not knowing that Daggett had given the money to Kinsey to pass on to Tony.
79	The police investigating Billy's murder discover a home-made silencer used in the killing. Kinsey immediately recognizes the toweling used for padding as coming from the Westfall household, and Ramona jumps to the top of her suspect list. This means confronting Tony, who has given Ramona an alibi for the time of Daggett's death. In pursuing Tony, Kinsey realises Tony himself, dressed as a woman in his aunt's wig, was actually the killer. He was also the one who stole her gun and killed Billy Polo, who had recognized Tony at Daggett's funeral. Killing the man who killed his family has done nothing to ease Tony's torment, however; and he commits suicide by throwing himself off a building in front of Kinsey, despite her best effort to talk him down.
80	The chair's first owner was Gray's patron, Suzanne Talbot. It was acquired by Parisian art dealer Cheska Vallois in 1971 for $2,700 and then sold by Vallois to the French fashion designer Yves Saint Laurent in 1973. The chair was put up for sale as part of the Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé collection in February 2009 at Christie's auction house in Paris. It sold for €21,905,000 against a pre-sale estimate of €2-3 million, establishing a new record for a piece of 20th century decorative art. The price beat the previous record by $22 million. The 2009 buyer of the chair was once again Cheska Vallois who later said that the cost of acquiring it was "the price of desire". The chair was bought by Vallois for an unknown third party erroneously reported to be Henry and Marie-Josée Kravis in March 2009.
81	Richard Swann Lull erected the species Dryosaurus grandis for foot elements from the Arundel Formation, including a phalanx and astragalus that had been previously assigned to "Allosaurus" medius Marsh, 1888. Gilmore (1920) placed Dryosaurus grandis in the genus Ornithomimus, which rendered Lull's name secondarily preoccupied by Ornithomimus grandis Marsh, 1890 and necessitated the replacement name Ornithomimus affinis. However, the holotype specimen of Ornithomimus grandis comes from the Eagle Sandstone of Montana and is presumed lost, rendering Gilmore's action unnecessary. Matthew and Brown (1922) assigned the species to Coelosaurus, as C. affinis.
82	Just after Christmas, Kinsey Millhone discovers that five thousand dollars has mysteriously been credited to her bank account. She flashes back a few days to when she was asked to investigate a fire claim at a factory in Colgate as part of her informal office space rental arrangement with California Fidelity Insurance. The business in question, Wood/Warren, is owned and operated by the Wood family, whom Kinsey has known on a personal level since high school. Company founder Linden Wood is dead. His son Lance now runs the company, and his four other children—Ebony, Olive, Ash and Bass—all have a stake. Ash is Kinsey's former schoolmate; and Bass was an acquaintance of her second ex-husband, Daniel Wade. Olive is married to Terry Kohler, Lance's second-in-command at the company. After a solitary Christmas, with Henry away visiting relatives and Rosie's Tavern shut down until the new year, Kinsey writes off the fire as an industrial accident. Upon submitting her report to her boss, she finds that significant papers have been removed from the file and others substituted, giving an appearance that Lance Wood has bribed Kinsey not to label the fire as arson. In the middle of protesting her innocence, the five thousand dollar credit takes on a sinister significance.
83	Temporarily suspended from California Fidelity, Kinsey takes up her own investigation to prove her innocence, aided (unwillingly at first) by CFI administrator Darcy. Darcy is united with Kinsey in her dislike of claims manager Andy Motycka, who is Kinsey's chief suspect in the set-up. She is at a loss and cannot imagine for whom he could be working. Kinsey reconnects with the Wood family and learns some of their dark family secrets: that Ebony, the oldest sister, wants control of the business and that Lance was practically a criminal in high school. She also learns that a former Wood/Warren employee, Hugh Case, committed suicide two years before, although the suspicious disappearance of all the lab work on Hugh's body seems to support his widow Lyda's claim that it was murder rather than suicide. Kinsey remains unconvinced by Lyda's conviction that Lance was Hugh's killer but can't seem to find any other leads. Her spirits are at a low ebb, and it's the worst possible moment for Daniel to show up (eight years after leaving without a word). Kinsey finds it hard to cope with but eventually agrees to store a guitar for him while he sorts himself out.
84	On her way to a new year party at Olive and Terry's home, Kinsey is almost killed when a bomb, disguised as a gift left on the doorstep, explodes. Olive is killed, and Terry is badly injured. Kinsey does her best to resist Daniel's attempts to nurse her, and her distrust is proven right when she finds out the guitar she has been storing for Daniel is bugged and that he has been reporting on her investigation to Ebony and Bass Wood. She discovers Daniel and Bass are lovers—Bass is the person for whom Daniel left her. Shortly afterwards, Kinsey finds Lyda Case's dead body in a car outside her apartment. Forcing answers from the Wood family, Kinsey learns an even darker family secret: that Lance had an incestuous affair with Olive when they were teenagers, leaving Olive emotionally and sexually scarred for the rest of her life. Kinsey's suspicions immediately jump to Terry Kohler; and when the police identify fingerprints on the car Lyda was found in as belonging to an escaped convicted bomber called Chris Emms, she realizes Terry and Emms are the same person.
85	Unfortunately, Emms has anticipated her solving the case and is waiting at her apartment with another bomb.  Before it explodes, he explains he killed Hugh Case because Hugh had realized his true identity; and he killed Lyda because she had belatedly found Hugh's records of that. He engineered the fire at Wood/Warren and set up Kinsey (with the aid of Andy Motycka) to get revenge on Lance after Bass spilled the family incest secret to him. Kinsey manages to shoot Emms and disables him sufficiently to get out of the bathroom window just as the bomb explodes, killing Emms and destroying her garage apartment.  After Daniel leaves with Bass, the only loose end is the five thousand dollars Emms put in her account; and on the advice of Lieutenant Dolan, Kinsey keeps it.
86	Henry Pitts is having Kinsey's garage apartment rebuilt after it was destroyed in the events of the previous novel. Royce Fowler wants the detective to exonerate his son of the murder of Jean Timberlake, seventeen years before, in Floral Beach, California. Bailey Fowler pleaded guilty to killing Jean, his sometime girlfriend, and escaped from prison soon afterwards. He has apparently been living the life of a model citizen under an assumed name. He is recaptured and is claiming his innocence. Kinsey heads to Floral Beach, a tiny local community, to pursue the cold trail; and she stays with the Fowler family at their motel. Royce is dying of cancer; his wife Oribelle is sick with diabetes; and their daughter Ann, Bailey's senior by five years, has taken leave of absence from her job as a counselor at the local high school to provide care for her parents.
87	Bailey's lawyer, Jack Clemson, fills her in on the details of the case: Jean, 17 when she died, was a problem child who was doing badly in school and engaged in numerous sexual encounters with the local boys at school—and some of the local men, as well. She was pregnant at the time of her death. Everyone knows everyone in Floral Beach, and Kinsey acquaints herself with a number of the locals in pursuit of the truth: Pearl, the local bar-owner, whose son's evidence put Bailey on the spot at the time of Jean's death; Tap Granger, who was Bailey's accomplice in several robberies before the murder; the local pastor, Reverend Haws, and his wife; and Dr. Dunne, whose wife Elva has a violent objection to being questioned. The high school principal at the time of the murder, Dwight Shales, offers some help. Attention is turned to Jean's single mother, Shana, whose friendship with Dwight is causing raised eyebrows around Floral Beach. She is struggling with longstanding alcohol problems, is less co-operative, and refuses to identify Jean's father. Nobody seems convinced that the killer could be anyone but Bailey.
88	She searches Ann's room and finds evidence that Ann supplied Tap with the hold-up gun and made the anonymous phone calls. Unfortunately, she also finds Ann waiting for her, armed with a shotgun. Jean had confided in her, as school counselor, that Dwight was the father of her child. Motivated by jealousy, Ann killed her; and being equally jealous of her brother's position as favored child of their parents, Ann was happy to see him take the rap. Her plan is to use the money she will eventually inherit from her parents to tempt Dwight into marriage. She killed her mother to hasten the plan along. She also killed Shana, Jean's mother, because she was jealous of her friendship with Dwight. Before Ann can kill Kinsey, she is interrupted by Royce, who wrestles the gun away from Ann, shooting her in the foot accidentally in the process.
89	The film includes many Italian celebrities; apart the already said Arbore, De Crescenzo and Benigni, there are also appearances by Pippo Baudo, Isabella Biagini, Gianni Boncompagni, Dino Cassio, Alfredo Cerruti, Maurizio Costanzo, Riccardo Pazzaglia, Lory del Santo, Gerardo Gargiulo, Isaac George, Cesare Gigli, Renato Guttuso, Andy Luotto, Nando Martellini, Andrea Giordana, Sandra Milo, Severino Gazzelloni, Gianni Minà, Domenico Modugno, Gaetano Cristiano Rossi, Gianni Morandi, Nando Murolo, Stella Pende, Gigi Proietti, Teodoro Ricci, Bobby Solo, Massimo Troisi, Vasco Rossi, Luciana Turina, Claudio Villa, Isabel Russinova, Martufello, Mario Marenco, Sergio Japino and Gepy & Gepy
90	In 2011, a colonel of the Colombian army received a sentence of 21 years in prison for his admitted involvement in the killing of two peasants who were then presented as guerrilleros. He also admitted that his unit had carried out 57 similar murders. He claimed that he learned of previous "false positive" killings when he first arrived at his unit, and was warned by Defence Minister Santos to obtain measurable results or lose his position. He later testified at other "false positive" trials. In 2013 a Colombian radio station played a tape on which the colonel is overheard extorting other army members with offers not to testify against them.
91	The text of a 2013 law which regulated and implemented the previous 2012 reform includes extrajudicial executions among a list of crimes which will continue to remain under civilian court jurisdiction and will not be submitted to military courts. Critics have expressed concern that the defense lawyers of military personnel accused in false positive cases may argue that their crimes are not extrajudicial executions (which were previously not defined as a crime in the Colombian penal code) but homicides, as a way to avoid the jurisdiction of civilian courts and request a transfer to military courts. Legislators who supported the bill have argued that another paragraph in the law expressly states that cases of false positives currently in civilian justice cannot be transferred to the military justice system.According to the report of the working group on the arbitrary detention of the United Nations, arbitrary deprivation of liberty has been used in other countries as one of the most common practices to imprison political opponents, religious dissidents or to restrict the freedom of expression, it has been found that these imprisonments are also based on the fight against terrorism.
92	In January 2009, the band released their third studio album Shin-shiro. To promote this, the band performed a national tour of Japan in February and March 2009, entitled Sakanaquarium 2009: Shinshiro. The 13 date tour began in Kyoto on February 14, and ended with two performances in Sapporo on March 20 and 21. Live audio from the tour final on March 21, 2009 at Penny Lane 24 in Sapporo was compiled into a thirty-minute single track to create the "Fish Alive" 30min., 1 Sequence by 6 Songs Sakanaquarium 2009 @ Sapporo release. The songs featured were "Ame(B)", "Light Dance", "Inner World", "Sample", "Minnanouta" and "Night Fishing Is Good". "Ame(B)", "Light Dance" and "Minnanouta" were all taken from Shin-shiro, however "Inner World" was originally from the band's debut album Go to the Future (2007), and "Sample" and "Night Fishing Is Good" from their second album Night Fishing (2008).
93	The phrase "Five stars rising in the east benefit China" (五星出東方利中國) resembles a similar phrase found in the Records of the Grand Historian's scroll 27 (五星分天之中，積於東方，中國利).  In the ancient times the five stars were represented as Chenxing (辰星), Taibai (太白), Yinghuo (熒惑), Suixing (歲星) and Zhenxing (鎭星).  In modern times these are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, respectively.  These are also represented by "Five Elements" with water, metal, earth, fire, wood.  Researchers from the Japanese observatory said the next alignment of the five stars to the east will not be until March 21, 2022.
94	The 3rd class medal is silver color, the second class is gold color, the 1st class is gold color, the crescent and the eight-pointed star are white color, the rifles are silver color and the anchor is black color. Rare side of the medal is flat with “For 20 years faultless service” words on the 1st class medal, “For 15 years of faultless service” on the 2nd class medal, with “For 10 years of faultless service” on the 3rd class medal in the center and with a crescent and an eight-pointed star on a national ornament. “Azerbaijani Republic” words at the top and “Armed Forces” words at the bottom are carved along the circle.
95	The medal is pinned to the chest with a satin ribbon of 27x43 mm size and a ring and loop. There are vertical olive and white color stripes of 1 mm width and blue and white color vertical stripes of 3 mm located in a sequence from the corners to the center of the satin ribbon. There is one vertical 1 mm gold color stripe on the 1st class medal, 2-3 such stripes on the 2nd and 3rd class medals. A 27x9 mm mould covered with the same satin is attached to the medal for pinning to the chest.
96	Thomas began performing at Detroit's Four Horsemen Club in 1940. She was discovered by Earl Carroll, who gave her the stage name "Frantic Fay." Thomas was featured with Earl Carroll's Vanities in the spring of 1944 and played eight months at Harry's Show Bar in Detroit. She was managed by Delbridge & Gorrell. Thomas played piano by ear. Billboard magazine described her style as "individual, with a jive touch," adding that "she is at her very best in an interpretation of the deep blues." Through the 1940s, she had appearances at hotels and bars around the country.
97	In 1949, Thomas recorded four songs for Leon René's Exclusive Records in Los Angeles: "I'm In Town," "Waga-Waga," "I Don't Want Your Money, Honey," and "Lover Man." Her first single "Waga-Waga" / "I Don't Want Your Money, Honey," was released in June 1949. Reviewing the single, Billboard wrote: "New thrush-88er packs a dynamite live style with something of Rose Murphy and Nellie Lutcher and plenty of her own. Her piano work is of pro caliber, too. The record "I Don't Want Your Money, Honey" was Cash Box magazine's Race Disk O' The Week. They noted that track was a "surefire clickeroo if ever there was one. Jut listen to this gal skim thru the 88's and gurgle, chuckle, giggle and sing, and make more sounds than you've heard in a month of Sundays." The single did well in local markets, but it did not chart nationally. Her second single, "I'm In Town" / "Lover Man," was released in September 1949. Later that year, Thomas had another session with Exclusive and recorded four more songs. The single "Thinking Of You" / "I Lost My Sugar In Salt Lake City" was released in December. That month, Exclusive declared bankruptcy and ceased operations in January 1950. Thomas never released another record.
98	In the 1950s, Thomas performed gigs around California. She married Lonnie I. Riggs in 1954. By the 1960s, Thomas had relocated back to Detroit; she performed around the Midwest. She died in Detroit on July 5, 1978. Years after her death, Thomas' songs were featured in the soundtracks of a few movies. "I'm In Town" was used in the films Men Of Honor (2000), Lonely Hearts (2006), and Trumbo (2015). One of her unreleased Exclusive tracks, "I Only Want You" was used in the films Lovelife (1997) and Second Skin (2000).
99	The nickname Freeway came from Ross owning properties along Los Angeles' Interstate 110, also known as the Harbor Freeway According to an October 2013 Esquire magazine article, "Between 1982 and 1989, federal prosecutors estimated, Ross bought and resold several metric tons of cocaine," with Ross' gross revenue claimed to be more than $900 million (equivalent to $2.7 billion in 2019) and profits of almost $300 million ($900 million in 2019). During the height of his drug dealing, Ross was said to have sold "$3 million in one day." According to the East Bay Times, "In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $500 million between 1983 and 1984."
100	In 1996, Ross was sentenced to life imprisonment under the three-strikes law after being convicted for purchasing more than 100 kilograms of cocaine from a federal agent in a sting operation. Later that year, a series of articles by journalist Gary Webb in the San Jose Mercury News revealed a connection between one of Ross's cocaine sources, Danilo Blandón, and the CIA as part of the Iran–Contra affair. Having learned to read at the age of 28, during his first stint in prison, Ross spent much of his time behind bars studying the law. He eventually discovered a legal loophole that would lead to his release. Ross's case was brought to a federal court of appeals which found that the three-strikes law had been erroneously applied and reduced his sentence to 20 years. He was released from Federal Correctional Institution, Texarkana on September 29, 2009.
101	The teacher referred Ross to his supplier, Ivan Arguellas, who offered to keep Ross supplied. Arguellas was able to provide larger quantities at a better price, and Ross quickly went from dealing in grams of cocaine to dealing in ounces. About eight months after becoming Ross's supplier, Arguellas was shot in the spine, resulting in months of hospitalization that forced him out of the cocaine business. His brother-in-law Henry Corrales took over the business, but was not enthusiastic about the trade and had failed to make any connections of his own to suppliers.
102	With thousands of employees, Ross has said he operated drug sales not only in Los Angeles but in places across the country including St. Louis, New Orleans, Texas, Kansas City, Oklahoma, Indiana, Cincinnati, North Carolina, South Carolina, Baltimore, Cleveland, and Seattle. He has said that his most lucrative sales came from the Ohio area. He made similar claims in a 1996 PBS interview. According to the East Bay Times, "In the course of his rise, prosecutors estimate that Ross exported several tons of cocaine to New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, and made more than $600 million in the process." Adjusting for inflation using the Consumer Price Index, this becomes more than a billion dollars in 2013.
103	After her first night in her new place, Kinsey heads out early the next day in search of Mrs Gersh's mother, Agnes Grey, who lives in a trailer in the desert. Agnes isn't home, and the trailer seems to be occupied by two teenage runaways; but Kinsey eventually tracks Agnes down at a local convalescent hospital, where she has been since being taken suddenly ill on a trip to a local town sometime before. Agnes, 83 years old, has not been a model patient; and the hospital staff are delighted to hear that she has relatives who can take responsibility for her. Irene makes plans to transfer Agnes to a facility in Santa Teresa. But Agnes seems terrified of going there and tells Kinsey a confused story about a number of people from the past, including Lottie and Emily, who died.
104	Kinsey makes plans to come home, but before she can do so, a man in a pick-up truck deliberately runs her off the road, seriously injuring Kinsey and totaling her treasured VW automobile.  Kinsey recognizes the driver as a man traveling with his young son she has seen a couple of times on the journey to the Slabs, and realizes she needs to take the death threat against her seriously. She hires Robert Dietz, the PI who helped her briefly on an earlier case, as a bodyguard. His vigilance initially frustrates Kinsey, who is used to making her own decisions; but they soon begin an affair. Dietz discovers the hitman is Mark Messinger, who absconded with his son, Eric, eight months previously. He arranges a meeting with the child's mother, Rochelle, who is desperate to get her son back, and offers to help her.
105	Meanwhile, Agnes goes missing only a few hours after getting to Santa Teresa. She is soon found, yet she dies of fright within a day. Kinsey and Robert Dietz suspect she was kept prisoner somewhere before her death. Irene suffers a serious panic reaction when she sees a tea set Kinsey found among her mother's possessions, and Kinsey suspects this has triggered a buried childhood memory. Further anomalies occur when Irene tries to fill in the paperwork relating to the death: Kinsey realizes that Irene's birth certificate is faked and that Agnes Grey is a pseudonym.  It's Kinsey's CFI colleague Darcy who points out Agnes Grey is the name of a novel by Anne Brontë, which seems to link to the names Emily and Lottie (Charlotte) Agnes had mentioned. Kinsey tracks down a family called Bronfen, who match the circumstances Agnes described, and surmises that the surviving brother of the family, Patrick, murdered Lottie and Emily. She is convinced that when Patrick killed Irene's mother, Sheila, Agnes Grey was Anne Bronfen, a third sister, who took off with Irene to protect her, changing their identities and posing as the young Irene's mother. The three daughters were presumably named for the Brontë sisters, which explains the alias Anne chose to use. Patrick faked Anne's death in order to gain sole possession of the family property.
106	Kinsey is convinced that Patrick is responsible for Agnes's death, to cover his past crimes, and discovers evidence of further killings at his home. When she confronts Patrick, she is interrupted by Messinger, who kills Patrick. Dietz and Rochelle have managed to get Eric away from Messinger, and Messinger's stated intention is to use Kinsey as a hostage to exchange for Eric. As she drives Messinger to the airport at gunpoint to intercept Rochelle, Kinsey is convinced Messinger will kill them all; and he succeeds in killing Rochelle's twin Roy, who was attempting to help her escape with Eric. However, Rochelle outsmarts Messinger and kills him first.
107	The "Go Home" vans were part of a controversial 2013 advertising campaign by the British Home Office in which advertising vans with slogans recommending that illegal immigrants should "go home or face arrest" were sent to tour areas with high immigrant populations. The hypothesis of the operation was that people who did not have leave to remain would voluntarily depart if "a near and present" danger, such as being arrested, was made apparent. The pilot programme, which had the internal codename 'Operation Vaken', ran in the six London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Barnet, Brent, Ealing, Hounslow, and Redbridge from 22 July to 22 August 2013, and was part of the Home Office hostile environment policy. In October 2013, the evaluation report stated that 60 voluntary departures were believed to be directly related to 'Operation Vaken' and 65 more cases were "currently being progressed to departure."
108	British politicians including Nick Clegg, Vince Cable and Eric Pickles expressed concerns about the campaign. Nigel Farage described the advertisements as "unpleasant." Yvette Cooper compared the slogans on the vans with slogans used by the National Front in the 1970s and the campaign was described by Diane Abbott as an example of dog-whistle politics, stating that "It is not so much dog-whistle politics as an entire brass band ... It is akin to scrawling 'Paki go home' on the side of buildings. I don't believe this policy is going to achieve anything besides stoking fear and resentment."
109	"Good Hair" and Other Dubious Distinctions is a 2011 documentary film directed, written and edited by Camille S. DeBose. The film focuses on cultural language and practices that negatively impact the development of a healthy sense of self. The filmmaker's commentary asserts a criticism of the way wavy hair, lighter skin and a slender nose are still considered more attractive in the black community in light of historical and contemporary movements which have sought to liberate black self-esteem. As a practicing and teaching sociologist, the filmmaker sought to illuminate the notion of symbolic violence through the lens of Pierre Bourdieu and spark conversation not just in the black community but all other communities as well. Cultural practices which value some features but not others are issues common to every family and every community. For the filmmaker this is an issue of valuing and finding beauty in every human being.
110	The film begins with a series of outdoor shots narrated by the filmmaker. The viewer follows her fuzzy form as she approaches the camera and tells a story of people remarking on the features they hope her unborn child will be born with. The film continues with a collection of personal stories juxtaposed against discussion and analysis from professionals and academics. Viewers get glimpses of the filmmaker's pregnant form as she travels through the landscape. The film ends with the sight of the filmmaker's child and a quote by bell hooks on shame and the life cycle.
111	In the new mood of nervous efficiency prevalent at CFI pending Titus's arrival, Kinsey is passed the claim file of Bibianna Diaz to investigate for possible fraud. Kinsey assumes a false identity as Hannah Moore in an attempt to befriend Bibianna, who, by co-incidence, is in a relationship with a former schoolmate and police-academy associate of Kinsey's, Jimmy Tate, recently relieved of police duties on the grounds of corruption. Bibianna has problems too, it seems: her former boyfriend Raymond Maldonaldo, of whom she is—rightly, as it turns out—terrified, is the jealous type and is hunting her down. Kinsey realises that a CFI colleague has inadvertently given away information on Bibianna to Raymond's gang, and things come to a head while she is out drinking with Bibianna and Tate. Raymond's brother Chago and his girlfriend Dawna accost Bibianna; and in the fracas that ensues, Tate shoots and kills Chago. Bibianna is taken into custody, Kinsey deliberately sticking to her in order to cement their relationship.
112	Kinsey's enforced overnight stay in the police 'tank' is interrupted by Lieutenant Dolan, who has a job offer for her: Raymond is the head of a huge insurance fraud gang, and the police want Kinsey to use her new position as Bibianna's confidante to get the evidence they need; there seems to be a leak somewhere in the police department, and they need someone unconnected whom they can trust to bring Raymond to justice. Kinsey withdraws her initial gut refusal when Dolan tells her Raymond killed Parnell but that they have been stalling the murder investigation in order not to jeopardize the longstanding fraud case. Kinsey agrees to help out of a sense of duty to Parnell; but the police plan to have Kinsey wired for her own protection goes awry, and she is left to fend for herself.
113	Thus begins a dangerous and stifling few days for Kinsey, undercover and up to her neck in a criminal ring headed by a deluded killer. Raymond effectively keeps both Kinsey and Bibianna under house arrest in Los Angeles, with the aid of his second in command, Luis. Raymond can't accept Bibianna's rejection of him and is determined to force her into marriage. The snag in the plan, which Bibianna doesn't dare confess, is that she has actually just married Tate.   Tensions run high, while Kinsey learns much about the car insurance fraud business, keeps her eyes open, and eventually establishes the leak is a clerk at the County Sheriff's office, whose father is a crooked doctor heavily involved in Raymond's ring.
114	Matters come to a head when Bibianna escapes and is pursued almost to her death by one of Raymond's henchmen. Visiting her in the hospital, the doctor inadvertently lets slip to Raymond that Bibianna's next of kin is her husband, Jimmy Tate. Enraged, Raymond shoots Jimmy. Kinsey sets off in hot pursuit and receives unexpected help from Luis, who turns out to be an undercover LAPD cop. Kinsey makes it back to Santa Teresa in the nick of time for her friend Vera Lipton's wedding. Both Bibianna and Tate survive; but despite her success in wrapping up the insurance fraud claim, Kinsey is fired from CFI by Gordon Titus.
115	"Happy" in Galoshes is the second solo album by American rock singer Scott Weiland. Weiland, known for his roles as the lead singer in Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver, released his first album, 12 Bar Blues in 1998.  Ten years later, "Happy" in Galoshes served as the official follow-up. Two versions have been released, a single disc and double disc deluxe version—the deluxe edition offers a second disc of 10 extra tracks.  The album was released November 25, 2008 on Weiland's own Softdrive Records. Produced by Doug Grean and Scott Weiland, with select tracks recorded by Steve Albini, the album features guest appearances by Paul Oakenfold and No Doubt members Adrian Young, Tony Kanal, and Tom Dumont. Oakenfold appears on a cover of David Bowie's "Fame." Weiland cited Bowie as one of his main influences. This is Weiland's final main solo album to featured the original material during his lifetime, as his next and final solo album The Most Wonderful Time of the Year (2011) only featured the cover of Christmas song.
116	In an interview with The Pulse of Radio regarding the album, Weiland stated:"It'll definitely be a sonic journey like the first album was, a little bit more focused since I'm not on a narcotic journey like I was on the last one. But, you know, still sort of all over the map, because my influences are so wide and varied." In an interview with MTV News, Weiland stated that the songs on "Happy" In Galoshes were inspired by the death of his brother, Michael (who also played drums on a song on the album), and Weiland's separation from his wife of eight years, Mary Forsberg.
117	Aiding & Abetting called "Helen Butte" vs. Madonna Pussy Badsmell "a nice collection of random musical violence. To Live and Shave in L.A. already has a fine reputation for this sort of musical mayhem, and this album doesn't disappoint." AllMusic gave the album two out of five stars, calling it a "disturbing cacophony melted on in several, short pieces" and a "predictable gimmick that wears thin early."  Jeff Bagato of the Washington City Paper enjoyed and said "musically, Moog, bass, guitar, and lots of tape manipulation (heavy-metal records are particularly in evidence) are sucked into the black hole of Tom Smith's mixing board and condensed into piles of slurred, guttural ranting, static, and broken rock."
118	"Hello, World!" programs vary in complexity between different languages. In some languages, particularly scripting languages, the "Hello, World!" program can be written  as a single statement, while in others (particularly many low-level languages) there can be many more statements required. For example, in Python, to print the string Hello, World! followed by a newline, one only needs to write print("Hello, World!"). In contrast, the equivalent code in C++ [1] requires the import of the input/output software library, the manual declaration of an entry point, and the explicit instruction that the output string should be sent to the standard output stream. Generally, programming languages that give the programmer more control over the machine will result in more complex "Hello, World" programs.
119	The phrase "Hello World!" has seen various deviations in punctuation and casing, such as the presence of the comma and exclamation mark, and the capitalization of the leading H and W. Some devices limit the format to specific variations, such as all-capitalized versions on systems that support only capital letters, while some esoteric programming languages may have to print a slightly modified string. For example, the first non-trivial Malbolge program printed "HEllO WORld", this having been determined to be good enough. Other human languages have been used as the output; for example, a tutorial for the Go programming language outputted both English and Chinese or Japanese characters, demonstrating the programming language's built-in Unicode support.
120	Some languages change the functionality of the "Hello, World!" program while maintaining the spirit of demonstrating a simple example. Functional programming languages, such as Lisp, ML and Haskell, tend to substitute a factorial program for "Hello, World!", as functional programming emphasizes recursive techniques, whereas the original examples emphasize I/O, which violates the spirit of pure functional programming by producing side effects. Languages otherwise capable of printing "Hello, World!" (Assembly, C, VHDL) may also be used in embedded systems, where text output is either difficult (requiring additional components or communication with another computer) or nonexistent. For devices such as microcontrollers, field-programmable gate arrays, and CPLDs, "Hello, World!" may thus be substituted with a blinking LED, which demonstrates timing and interaction between components.
121	"Time to hello world" (TTHW) is the time it takes to author a "Hello, World!" program in a given programming language. This is one measure of a programming language's ease-of-use; since the program is meant as an introduction for people unfamiliar with the language, a more complex "Hello, World!" program may indicate that the programming language is less approachable. The concept has been extended beyond programming languages to APIs, as a measure of how simple it is for a new developer to get a basic example working; a faster time indicates an easier API for developers to adopt.
122	"Heroes" is the 12th studio album by English musician David Bowie, released on 14 October 1977 by RCA Records. After releasing Low earlier that year, Bowie toured as the keyboardist of his friend and singer Iggy Pop. At the conclusion of the tour, they recorded Pop's second solo album Lust for Life at Hansa Tonstudio in West Berlin before Bowie regrouped there with collaborator Brian Eno and producer Tony Visconti to record "Heroes". It was the second instalment of his "Berlin Trilogy", following Low and preceding Lodger (1979). Of the three albums, it was the only one wholly recorded in Berlin. Much of the same personnel from Low returned for the sessions, augmented by King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp.
123	The cover photo, like Iggy Pop's The Idiot, is a nod to the painting Roquairol by German artist Erich Heckel. Upon release, "Heroes" was a commercial success, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and number 35 on the US Billboard 200. It was the best-received work of the "Berlin Trilogy" on release, with NME and Melody Maker naming it Album of the Year. Bowie promoted the album extensively, appearing on several television programmes and interviews. He supported Low and "Heroes" on the Isolar II world tour throughout 1978, performances of which have appeared on the live albums Stage (1978) and Welcome to the Blackout (2018).
124	Retrospectively, "Heroes" has continued to receive positive reviews, many reviewers praising Bowie's growth as an artist and Fripp's contributions. Although critical opinion has tended to view Low as the more groundbreaking record, "Heroes" is regarded as one of Bowie's best and most influential works. The title track, initially unsuccessful as a single, remains one of Bowie's best-known and acclaimed songs. An altered and obscured version of the cover artwork later appeared as the artwork for Bowie's 2013 album The Next Day. The album has been reissued several times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set.
125	In the second half of 1976, David Bowie moved to Switzerland with his wife Angela to escape the drug culture of Los Angeles. He then moved to the Château d'Hérouville in Hérouville, France with his friend, singer Iggy Pop, where the two recorded his debut studio album The Idiot in the summer of 1976. After meeting with musician Brian Eno the same year, Bowie, producer Tony Visconti and Eno began work on Low, the first instalment of what would come to be known as the "Berlin Trilogy". Recording for Low began in September 1976 and continued through November, finishing up at Hansa Studios in West Berlin, following Bowie and Pop's move there.
126	RCA Records stalled on releasing Low for three months, fearing poor commercial performance. Upon its eventual release in January 1977, it received little to no promotion from both RCA and Bowie himself, who felt it was his "least commercial" record up to that point and instead opted to tour as Pop's keyboardist. The tour, launched to support The Idiot, lasted from March to April 1977. After the tour's completion, Bowie and Pop returned to Hansa Tonstudio 2, where they recorded Pop's next solo album Lust for Life in two and a half weeks, from May to June 1977. By the time he finished Lust for Life, Bowie was ready to begin work on his next record. In mid-June, he travelled to Paris to undertake his first promotional appearances in over a year. He filmed a music video for his Low single "Be My Wife", then taped two interviews with French journalists a week later. Afterwards, Bowie contacted Eno to discuss their next collaboration. The two spent a few weeks devising concepts and ideas for the new album before they were joined by Visconti, who was busy with other commitments.
127	For the album, Bowie, Visconti and Eno regrouped at Hansa Studio 2 in West Berlin. Although the album was the second instalment of Bowie's "Berlin Trilogy", it was the only one recorded entirely in Berlin. The studio was a former concert hall converted into a recording studio that had been used by Gestapo officers during World War II as a ballroom. The studio was located about 500 yards from the Berlin Wall, leading Bowie to describe it as "the hall by the wall". Describing how the location of the studio affected the creative process, Visconti recalled: "Every afternoon I'd sit down at [a] desk and see three Russian Red Guards looking at us with binoculars, with their Sten guns over their shoulders, and the barbed wire, and I knew that there were mines buried in that wall, and that atmosphere was so provocative and so stimulating and so frightening that the band played with so much energy". Guitarist Carlos Alomar told biographer David Buckley: "These things [Germans, Nazis, the Wall, oppression] are hanging in the air, and when things get darker physically, you kind of think of darker themes too. Berlin was a rather dark, industrial place to work." Despite the dark atmosphere, Visconti particularly had an exciting time creating the album, saying, "It was one of my last great adventures in making albums."
128	Most of the album was recorded with the same personnel as its predecessor Low, with Alomar, George Murray and Dennis Davis as the core band. Bowie played piano, having gotten significantly more experience playing the instrument during his time with Pop. An addition to the lineup was guitarist Robert Fripp, formerly of the band King Crimson, who was recruited at Eno's suggestion. The guitarist recalled: "I got a phone call [from Brian Eno] when I was living in New York in July 1977. He said that he and David were recording in Berlin and passed me over. David said, 'Would you be interested in playing some hairy rock 'n' roll guitar?' I said, 'Well, I haven't really played for three years – but, if you're prepared to take a risk, so will I.' Shortly afterward, a first-class ticket on Lufthansa arrived." Upon his arrival to the studio, Fripp sat down and recorded lead guitar parts for tracks he had never heard before. He also received little guidance from Bowie, who had yet to write lyrics or melodies. Fripp completed all his guitar parts in three days. Fripp's playing received significant praise from Visconti and Eno, who were impressed with Fripp's ability to play for songs he had never heard before with such "virtuosity". According to biographer Nicholas Pegg, Fripp was not Bowie's first choice. Michael Rother of the German band Neu! had originally been approached to contribute, but shortly before the sessions began, he was contacted by an unknown person and informed that Bowie had changed his mind, although later interviews with Bowie suggested otherwise.
129	While producing other Bowie records, Visconti found that new ideas were flowing at a consistent basis and because of this, sometimes they tended to be forgotten. In order to counteract this, he kept a two-track tape running at all times. Murray recalled: "Tony had the insight to see what was happening in rehearsals so he just switched on the tape machines and let them run." Visconti himself later recalled: "It came in handy so many times...because we'd get lost. We'd start with an idea then go in the wrong direction, and after an hour we'd say 'How did this start again?'" During the sessions for Low, Visconti became frustrated with the lack of studio staff present at the Château. At Hansa however, he was assisted by in-house engineer Eduard Meyer, whom Visconti recalled was critical in maintaining a positive atmosphere. Likewise, the mood during the "Heroes" was brighter and more optimistic than the sessions for Low. Bowie in particular was in a healthier state of mind. He and Visconti would travel around Berlin frequently and one on such occasion, they met Antonia Maass, a local jazz singer who would go on to provide backing vocals on "Heroes".
130	According to biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook, the recording process for "Heroes" began in a very quick pace, following along from the Low's process, with the basic backing tracks for side one being completed in just two days. Working the same way he did on Low, Visconti fed Davis's drums through his Eventide H910 Harmonizer, giving it what Seabrook calls a "distinctive, high-tech sheen"; Davis also added congas and timpani to his set to take advantage of the large studio space. Visconti gave high praise to Davis, calling him "one of the best drummers I've ever worked with," further calling Alomar and Murray "amazing musicians...you'd just throw a few chord changes at them and they'd run with it." In an interview with NME later in the year, Eno said the initial phase of recording was "all done in a very casual kind of way." Bowie gave "very brief instruction", then the band would play. Hesitant at first, Eno found the process surprisingly effective, with most tracks being done in one take. Eno stated, "We did second takes, but they weren't nearly as good." Overall, Eno has a much greater role on "Heroes" than he had for Low, being credited as co-author on four of the ten songs, leading Seabrook to call it the "truer" collaboration. Eno himself stated "We both worked on all the pieces all the time." Eno would act as "assistant director" to Bowie, giving feedback to the musicians and suggesting new – and unusual – ways to approach the tracks. One of these ways was the employment of Eno's Oblique Strategies cards. According to O'Leary, these cards were "part-fortune cookie, part-Monopoly 'Chance' cards", intended to spark creative ideas. Although these cards were used greatly throughout the Lodger sessions, Eno and Bowie only used them on "Heroes" when creating the instrumentals, including on "V-2 Schneider", "Sense of Doubt" and "Moss Garden".
131	Following the initial sessions in July, recording for "Heroes" became more sporadic, with overdubs, vocals and mixing lasting until August. Like its predecessor, lyrics weren't written or recorded until all but Bowie and Visconti departed. Seabrook characterises this stage of recording as "sporadic bursts of inspiration surrounded by longer stretches of contemplation." When making The Idiot and Lust for Life with Iggy Pop, Bowie became fascinated with Pop's ability to improvise lyrics while standing at the microphone. For "Heroes", he decided to use the same method. Visconti later attested: "He'd never have a clue what he'd sing about until he actually walked in front of the microphone." Bowie usually completed his vocals in only one or two takes; Visconti provided backing vocals in the same fashion. The final mixes were done at Mountain Studios in Montreux, Switzerland, a studio that would become one of Bowie's mainstays. An engineer at Mountain, Dave Richards, would also become one of his regulars. Richards' assistant was Eugene Chaplin, the son of silent film star Charlie Chaplin.
132	As the second release of the "Berlin Trilogy", the music on "Heroes" expands on the material found on its predecessor Low. The songs have been described by Consequence of Sound as art rock and experimental rock, while also further continuing Bowie's work in the electronic and ambient genres. Like its predecessor, the songs on "Heroes" emphasise tone and atmosphere rather than guitar-based rock. However, the songs have been described as more positive in both tone and atmosphere than the songs of its predecessor. Visconti would describe the album as "a very positive version of Low." Biographer Paul Trynka writes that the record evokes "both past and future." It also follows the same structure as its predecessor, with side one featuring more conventional tracks, and side two featuring mostly instrumental tracks.
133	Author Peter Doggett writes that whereas Low featured lyrics of autobiographical nature, the lyrics of "Heroes" were "oblique and often deliberately evasive", and were sung with an "astonishing[ly]" amount of passion. Visconti recalled that lyrics were made up on the spot, with Bowie sometimes ad-libbing entire songs, singing "at the top of his lungs". Songs of this instance included "Joe the Lion", a tribute to American artist Chris Burden, who was known for his outlandish publicity stunts, and "Blackout", which references the New York City blackout of 1977. Like the second side of Low, the imagery of the Berlin Wall dominates "Heroes" throughout; a kiss between Visconti and Maass at the foot of the Wall inspired a lyric for the title track. Bowie's vocal for "'Heroes'" goes from calm and playful to a near-scream, a style he called "Bowie histrionics". Musically, Fripp's guitar feedback dominates throughout, while the bass pulsates and Eno synthesisers blends in the background. Bowie explained the song is about "facing reality and standing up to it" and finding joyness in life. Buckley particularly highlights the lyric "We can be heroes, just for one day" as "an acknowledgment that the future didn't belong to him anymore, [but] to everyone".
134	"Sons of the Silent Age" was the only song written before the sessions began and was originally intended to be the album's title track. The lyrics are influenced by the works of Jacques Brel and follow several characters that are, in O'Leary's words, "part-homo superior/part-Bewlay Brothers". Musically, the song is noted by biographers as different than the rest of the songs on the album, in that the themes present reflect ideals from the previous decade rather than the contemporary, while O'Leary likens its sound to that of Hunky Dory (1971) than the rest of the album. Biographers also consider the album's closer, "The Secret Life of Arabia", as a precursor to what Bowie would explore on Lodger.
135	The instrumentals are described by Buckley as dark and gloomy. "Sense of Doubt" puts a repeating four-note piano motif against a set of synthesisers to paint an image of a barren landscape. Bowie plays the Japanese instrument koto on "Moss Garden" which, together with synths, evoke a sound resembling aeroplanes flying overhead; Bowie further emphasises his fascination with Japan by stating he's "under Japanese influence" in "Blackout". The track segues into "Neuköln", which is named after a district in Berlin of the same name. The track uses sound to capture the feeling of despair and desperation that the Turkish immigrants who lived there experienced.
136	The majority of Low was influenced by Krautrock bands such as Tangerine Dream, Kraftwerk and Neu! Earlier in 1977, Kraftwerk name-checked both Bowie and Iggy Pop on the title track of Trans-Europe Express, which was Kraftwerk's response to the title track of Station to Station. Although the influence of Kraftwerk and Harmonia are less prominent on "Heroes" in favour of Edgar Froese, Bowie paid tribute by naming the album after Neu!'s track "Hero" from their album Neu! '75, while "V-2 Schneider" is inspired by and named after Kraftwerk's Florian Schneider. However, many British listeners assumed "V-2" was a reference to the type of rockets used by the German army in World War II. "V-2 Schneider" is also notable for having an off-beat saxophone part played by Bowie, who began the take on the wrong beat but decided he liked it better and kept it as is.
137	The cover photo was taken by Japanese photographer Masayoshi Sukita. Like the artwork for Iggy Pop's The Idiot, the cover is a nod to German artist Erich Heckel's paintings Roquairol and Young Man. Pegg describes Bowie's pose as "a wild-eyed Bowie locked in a rigid pose of serio-comic agitation, raising a flat palm as though he has just mimetically lifted the final mask of artifice from his face." In an interview with Charles Shaar Murray of NME, Bowie said that the quotation marks in the title "indicate a dimension of irony about the word 'heroes' or about the whole concept of heroism". Visconti would later state that the album was "heroic" in that it was a very positive period of Bowie's life and during the making of the album, everyone felt like heroes. Regarding the title, Bowie said, "I thought I'd pick on the only narrative song to use as the title," quipping he could have titled it The Sons of Silent Ages.
138	The title track was chosen as the lead single and released on 23 September 1977, with fellow album track "V-2 Schneider" as the B-side and the catalogue number RCA PB 1121. It was released in a shortened edited form in the hopes of more airplay, but Buckley believes this edit results in the song losing some of its "dramatic appeal". It was supported by a music video, shot in Paris and directed by Nick Ferguson, that features Bowie in the same jacket on the album cover against a backdrop of white light. For the German and French releases of the single, titled "'Helden'" and "'Héros'", respectively, Bowie re-recorded his vocals in both languages, with lyrics translated by Antonia Maass for the German release. Despite the song's later mass acclaim, it was initially a failure, peaking at number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and failing to chart in the US. Pegg and Chris O'Leary note that it wasn't until Bowie's Live Aid performance in 1985 did the song become recognised as a classic. Bowie later remarked in 2003: "This is a strange phenomenon that happens with my songs Stateside. Many of the crowd favourites were never radio or chart hits, and '"Heroes"' tops them all."
139	"Heroes" was released on 14 October 1977 by RCA Records, with the catalogue number RCA PL 12522. Its release came four months after the Clash's debut album and two weeks before the Sex Pistols' Never Mind the Bollocks, two influential records in the punk rock movement. Buckley notes Bowie's 1974 album Diamond Dogs as an influence on punk, as well as Bowie himself, in terms of both music and fashion. RCA marketed the album with the slogan "There's Old Wave. There's New Wave. And there's David Bowie ..." Trynka praises the slogan as "a masterful piece of positioning that allowed David to remain aloof from a punk movement that, like glam before it, would turn into a parody of itself." Unlike Low, Bowie himself promoted the album extensively, conducting numerous interviews and performing on various television programmes, including Marc, Bing Crosby's Merrie Olde Christmas (where he recorded "Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy" with Crosby), and Top of the Pops (where he performed the title track). Regarding his extensive promotion, Bowie explained at the time:
140	The album was a commercial success in the UK, peaking at number 3 on the UK Albums Chart and remained on the chart for 33 weeks. It fared less favourably in the US, where it peaked at number 35 on the Billboard 200, spending 19 weeks on the chart. Doggett writes that the album ended a string of eight top 20 albums in the US, becoming his worst-selling album there since 1971's Hunky Dory. RCA released "Beauty and the Beast" as the second single on 6 January 1978, with "Sense of Doubt" as the B-side and the catalogue number RCA 1190. It became a minor success in the UK, peaking at number 39 on the UK Singles Chart, staying on the chart for three weeks. NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray remarked that its "jarring, threatening edge...obviously put off a great many of the floating singles buyers attracted by the intoxicating romanticism of its immediate predecessor". The single was released in the US and Spain on a 12" promo and in a five-minute extended form, which failed to chart despite having "Fame" as the B-side.
141	On release, "Heroes" received very positive reviews from music critics. Allan Jones of Melody Maker named it "album of the year", calling it and its predecessor "among the most adventurous and notably challenging records yet thrust upon the rock audience." Angus MacKinnon of NME also named it the magazine's "album of the year", calling it Bowie's "most moving performance in years" and commended the artist's growing maturity. Kris Needs of ZigZag magazine further praised the record, noting that Bowie appeared to be continuing the musical explorations of Low, while at the same time, allowing listeners time to "catch up with Low." Needs ultimately described the album as "a strange, cold sometimes impenetrable album, but Bowie makes all these unlikely ingredients work." Writing in Hit Parader, American musician and author Patti Smith praised it as "a cryptic product of a high order of intelligence."
142	The record was not without its detractors. Tim Lott of Record Mirror gave the album a more mixed assessment, calling it "disjointed" and criticised the instrumentals on side two as having less "continuity" than the ones found on Low. Lott further considered Bowie's vocals "hollow" and the lyrics "opaque". Overall, although he felt it was intriguing, he stated: "As an album, "Heroes" stuns for just [the title] track. The rest is clever, but not brilliant and you expect no less from Bowie. In that sense it's a disappointment, a come-down from Low." In the US, a reviewer for Billboard also gave a mixed assessment, calling it an "extension" of both "Bowie's cosmic rock vision" and Low, and overall felt the record was "a musical excursion into a realm only Bowie himself can define." In the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hillburn lamented the way Bowie's "fluctuating pop interests caused him to shift from style to style faster than his ability to master them."
143	Some reviewers commented on Eno's contributions, including Bart Testa of Rolling Stone, who highlighted Eno's involvement. He contended that after Bowie's "auteurist exploitation" of the former on Low, "Heroes" "prompts a much more enthusiastic reading of the collaboration, which here takes the form of a union of Bowie's dramatic instincts and Eno's unshakable sonic serenity". The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau was less receptive to Eno's contributions, particularly the second side's instrumentals, saying that they are "interesting background" but "merely noteworthy as foreground, admirably rather than attractively ragged", in comparison to "their counterparts on Low". In the Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, "Heroes" finished 21st in the voting for 1977's top album.
144	Retrospective reviews continue to be positive, with many reviewers praising Bowie's growth as an artist and Fripp's contributions. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the album, noting the growing artistic maturity compared to its predecessor. He further praised the addition of Fripp, stating that his guitar adds a greater "musical foundation" to the electronic sound. He ultimately writes: "The difference between Low and "Heroes" [essentially] lies in the details, but the record is equally challenging and groundbreaking." Ryan Dombal of Pitchfork similarly praised the record, calling Bowie's vocal performances some of his finest and highlighted Fripp as the standout. In a review in which he commended the entire "Berlin Trilogy", Dombal identified "Heroes" as the album that indicated the most artistic growth for Bowie, after turning 30 and escaping years of drug addiction. Many reviewers and biographers have particularly highlighted the title track as one of Bowie's finest, with some considering it his greatest song.
145	Upon completion of his promotional appearances for "Heroes", Bowie flew to New York to record narration for an adaptation of Sergei Prokofiev's classical composition Peter and the Wolf, which was released as an album in May 1978. Bowie later said that it was a Christmas present for his son, Duncan Jones, then 7 years old. Afterwards, Bowie returned to Switzerland, where he was approached by director David Hemmings to appear in his upcoming film Just a Gigolo. Bowie agreed to the project due to wanting to work with Hemmings, whom he called "a real actor's director", the idea of starring in a film set in pre-Holocaust Berlin, and after learning actress Marlene Dietrich would be coming out of her almost two-decade-long retirement to star in the film. Shooting began in January 1978 and was troublesome: Bowie filed for divorce during shooting and Dietrich refused to leave her Paris apartment. Thus, the two never met and their scenes were shot separately and spliced together for the finished product. Released in February 1979, Just a Gigolo was panned by both critics and audiences. Bowie himself was critical of the film, calling it "my 32 Elvis Presley movies rolled into one" in an interview with NME.
146	After filming his scenes for Just a Gigolo in February 1978, Bowie began rehearsals for an upcoming tour. The Isolar II world tour, also known as "the Stage tour", lasted from March to the end of the year. Songs from both Low and "Heroes" made up the majority of the shows, while Ziggy Stardust-era songs and other hits from 1973 to 1976 were played. By now Bowie had broken his drug addiction; Buckley writes that the tour was "Bowie's first tour for five years in which he had probably not anaesthetised himself with copious quantities of cocaine before taking the stage. ... Without the oblivion that drugs had brought, he was now in a healthy enough mental condition to want to make friends." Performances from the tour were released on the live album Stage in September the same year, and again from a different venue in 2018 on Welcome to the Blackout.
147	In 1997, American composer Philip Glass adapted the album into a classical suite, titled "Heroes" Symphony. A follow-up to his earlier 1992 adaptation of Low, titled "Low" Symphony, the piece is separated into six movements, each named after tracks on "Heroes". Like its predecessor, Glass acknowledged Eno's contributions as equal to Bowie's on the original album and credited the movements to the two equally. Unlike the "Low" Symphony, the "Heroes" Symphony was developed into a ballet by American choreographer Twyla Tharp. Both the ballet and Symphony were greeted with acclaim. Bowie and Glass remained in contact with each other until 2003 and discussed making a third symphony, which never came to fruition. After Bowie's death in 2016, Glass stated the two had talked about adapting Lodger for the third symphony, which adapted as his 12th symphony in 2019. Glass described Low and "Heroes" as "part of the new classics of our time".
148	The cover of Bowie's 2013 album, The Next Day, is an altered and obscured version of the "Heroes" cover. This version has the word "'Heroes'" crossed out and Bowie's face obscured by an opaque white box reading "The Next Day". Designer Jonathan Barnbrook explained that Bowie had a feeling of isolation when making "Heroes" and he wanted to recapture that feeling for The Next Day. He further emphasised: "We tried out every single Bowie cover there's been, but it ended up as "Heroes" because it's such an iconic album, and the image on the front has the right kind of distance...The Next Day, in combination with the "Heroes" image, and what the album is saying about somebody who's looking back at his age...it just felt appropriate."
149	Although "Heroes" was the most well-received work of the "Berlin Trilogy" on release, in subsequent decades, critical and public opinion has typically fallen in favour of Low as the more groundbreaking record due to its daring experimental achievements. Pegg writes that the album is rather seen as an extension or refinement upon its predecessor's achievements rather than a "definitive new work" on its own. Seabrook agrees, noting that Low had the advantage of being released first and seen as "the greatest and canniest musical move" of Bowie's entire career. However, he writes that compared to other records released in 1977, "Heroes" still "sounds like a blast from the future." Nevertheless, "Heroes" has been regarded as one of Bowie's best and most influential works. In 2018, the writers of Consequence of Sound ranked "Heroes" as Bowie's fifth-greatest album, writing: "The weary 'optimism' of "Heroes" is mesmerizing. Even on its gloomiest tracks, there's this upbeat, impassioned impression that everything's okay, even just for one day." In 2020, Brian Kay of Classic Rock History ranked "Heroes", along with Low and Lodger, as Bowie's seventh greatest work, calling the trilogy a "fascinating chapter" in Bowie's life. In 2013, NME ranked the album 329th in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. Based on "Heroes"' appearances in professional rankings and listings, the aggregate website Acclaimed Music lists it as 11th most acclaimed album of 1977, the 81st most acclaimed album of the 1970s and the 253rd most acclaimed album in history.
150	In 2017, the album was remastered for the A New Career in a New Town (1977–1982) box set released by Parlophone that September. It was released in CD, vinyl, and digital formats, as part of this compilation and then separately in February 2018. A volume shift in the 2017 remaster of the title track received ire from fans and critics, but Parlophone proceeded to describe it as intentional and unalterable, because of damages in the original master tapes. After the critical voices would not lessen, a statement was released on the official Bowie website announcing corrected replacement disks for the "Heroes" CD and LP; the replacement disc offer lasted until June 2018. The amended remaster featured on the replacement discs was also used for the standalone CD and LP release of "Heroes" in February 2018.
151	"'Heroes'" is a song by English singer-songwriter David Bowie. It was co-written by Bowie and Brian Eno, produced by Bowie and Tony Visconti, and recorded in July and August 1977 at Hansa Studio by the Wall. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his 12th studio album of the same name, backed with the song "V-2 Schneider". A product of Bowie's "Berlin" period, the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or the United States after its release, but it has since become one of his signature songs. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the UK Singles Chart. "'Heroes'" has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after "Rebel Rebel".
152	Richard Buskin of Sound on Sound described "'Heroes'" as a "highly experimental piece of art rock". The music, co-written by Bowie and Eno, is in a two-chord progression (D–G), with a "brief excursion to familiar chords" in the key of G. Biographer David Buckley likens it to a Wall of Sound production, a forceful and noisy arrangement of guitars, percussion and synthesizers. Eno said the song always "sounded grand and heroic" and that he had "that very word – heroes – in my mind" even before Bowie wrote the lyrics. The backing track consists of a conventional arrangement of piano, bass guitar, rhythm guitar and drums. The other parts consist of synthesiser parts by Eno using an EMS VCS3 to produce detuned low-frequency drones, with the beat frequencies from the three oscillators, producing a juddering effect. In addition, King Crimson guitarist Robert Fripp generated an unusual sustained sound by allowing his guitar to feedback and sitting at different positions in the room to alter the pitch of the feedback. Visconti mixed out Dennis Davis' kick drum, stating that the track "seemed to plod" with it but had a more energetic feel without it.
153	Bowie's vocal was recorded after most of the session musicians had departed Berlin, with a "multi-latch" system devised by Visconti that creatively misused gating, a recording technique to control volume. Three microphones were used to capture the vocal, with one microphone nine inches from Bowie, one 20 feet away, and one 50 feet away. Each microphone was muted as the next one was triggered. As the music built, Bowie was forced to sing at increased volumes to overcome the gating effect, leading to an increasingly impassioned vocal performance as the song progresses. Jay Hodgson writes, 
154	"'Heroes'" was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single of Bowie's 12th studio album of the same name by RCA Records (as RCA / PB 11121), with a length of 3:32, and with fellow album track "V-2 Schneider" as the B-side. It subsequently appeared, with a longer length of 6:07, as the third track, between "Joe the Lion" and "Sons of the Silent Age", on the album in October the same year. Another 12" single, containing both the single and album versions, was released in the US by RCA Victor (as RCA / JD-11151) the same year. The German and French versions, titled "'Helden'" and "'Héros'", respectively, was released by RCA (RCA / PC-9821). Despite a large promotional push, including Bowie's first live Top of the Pops appearance since 1973, "'Heroes'" reached only number 24 in the UK charts, and failed to make the US Billboard Hot 100. In Italy, the song was certified gold by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry.
155	Writing for NME on its release, Charlie Gillett slated the record, saying: "Well he had a pretty good run for our money, for a guy who was no singer. But I think his time has been and gone, and this just sounds weary. Then again, maybe the ponderous heavy riff will be absorbed on the radio, and the monotonous feel may just be hypnotic enough to drag people into buying it. I hope not." Despite the poor review it featured at number 6 in the NME's end of year critics poll for 1977.
156	Later assessments were more favourable. In February 1999, Q magazine listed "'Heroes'" as one of the 100 greatest singles of all time as voted by the readers. In March 2005, the same magazine placed it at number 56 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In 2004, Rolling Stone rated "'Heroes'" number 46 in its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was included in 2008's The Pitchfork Media 500: Our Guide to the Greatest Songs from Punk to the Present.  John J. Miller of National Review rated "'Heroes'" number 21 on a list of "the 50 greatest conservative rock songs" due to its anti-Soviet political context. It has also become a gay anthem. Uncut placed "'Heroes'" at number 1 in its 30 greatest Bowie songs in 2008.
157	American rock band the Wallflowers recorded a version of the song for the soundtrack to the 1998 monster film Godzilla. This version peaked at number 10 on the US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart in 1998, as well as number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart and number 23 on the Billboard Top 40 Mainstream chart. In Canada, the single topped the RPM Alternative 30 for six weeks and reached number 13 on the RPM Top Singles chart. British duo Dom and Nic directed the song's music video.
158	Robin of the Batman TV series is noted for his many catchphrase "Holy..." exclamations. The lines in the 1960s TV series were uttered by Burt Ward who played Robin, who delivered the exclamations in a nasal voice. Many of the camp quips are directly related to the plot; for example, "Holy Graf Zeppelin!" is uttered by Robin upon seeing an aerial balloon. In his cameo on the Arrowverse crossover "Crisis on Infinite Earths", Burt Ward exclaims, "Holy crimson skies of death!" while Earth-66 experiences red skies due to the incoming antimatter wave.
159	According to New York wellness expert Scott A. Morofsky, Robin would "inevitably refer to an intense experience with a loud, 'Holy... Batman, what do we do now?'". Bradley J. Ricca, comic book scholar at Case Western Reserve University, suggests that: "Robin exists as a media entity inextricably linked with Batman and shares nearly as much ubiquity in American culture". He considers Robin's famous "Holy..." catchphrases to have been grossly overused in the series, popularizing it in the American vernacular. Cartoons such as The Super Friends continued to make use of Robin and his catchphrases, "spouting 'Holy' in front of every noun imaginable" and Robin's exclamations still remain closely associated with his character in popular culture.
160	American author David Shields notes how much in contrast Robin's "Holy..." outbursts, his alliteration and assonance, his fast riffs were to the laconic Batman. According to film critics Deborah Cartmell and Imelda Whelehan, Robin's quip "Holey Rusted Metal!" in Batman Forever was an "explicit in-joke". Camp humour, through Robin's exclamations and other circumstances in the Batman series, have led some commentators to speculate on homosexual undertones in the relationship between Batman and Robin. Image Entertainment paid homage to Robin's quips with the title "Batman: Holy Batmania" in a 2004 2-disc DVD release containing four documentaries discussing the sixties TV series. The DVD title is the name of one of the documentaries itself.
161	The "Honour of the Nation" Decoration (Albanian: Dekorata "Nderi i Kombit") is the highest decoration to be given in Albania, among the Civil awards and decorations of Albania, and was instituted by special law No. 8113, of 28 March 1996, entitled Për dekoratat në Republikën e Shqipërisë (English: On decorations in the Republic of Albania), later amended by law  No. 112/2013 Për dekoratat, titujt e nderit, medaljet dhe titujt vendorë të nderit në Republikën e Shqipërisë (English: On decorations, honorific titles, medals and other titles in the Republic of Albania).
162	"'Hope' is the thing with feathers" is a lyric poem in ballad meter written by American poet Emily Dickinson, The manuscript of this poem appears in Fascicle 13, which Dickinson compiled around 1861. It is one of 19 poems included in the collection, in addition to the poem "There's a certain Slant of light." With the discovery of Fascicle 13 after Dickinson's death by her sister, Lavinia Dickinson, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" was subsequently published in 1891 in a collection of her works under the title Poems, which was edited and published by Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd.
163	"'Hope' is the thing with feathers" was first compiled in one of Dickinson's hand-sewn fascicles, which was written during and put together in 1861. In the 1999 edition of The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Reading Edition, R.W. Franklin changed the year of appearance from 1861, where the holograph manuscript exists, to 1862. It is listed in the appendix that poems numbered 272 to 498 were written during this year, which amounted to the third most poems Dickinson wrote in the span of years from 1860 to 1865, at 227. The edition that Dickinson included in the fascicle was text B, according to Franklin. No current holograph manuscript exists of the first written version of this selection. "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" first appeared in print in a second series of her poetry, titled Poems by Emily Dickinson, second series in 1891. It was published out of Boston.
164	Upon the original publication, her poems were reassessed and transcribed by Thomas H. Jefferson in 1955. They became the first scholarly collection of Dickinson's work. His transcription of her works from her fascicles was taken from the earliest fair copy of her poetic works. Within the Johnson collection, "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" is poem number 254. Franklin, in his edition of her works, used the last fair copy of her poems. It is marked as number 314 in his collection and can be found under such in the Norton Anthology of Poetry.
165	Fascicle 13 is the bound edition of her written poetry that contains "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" written in Dickinson's hand. According to the work done by Franklin, there are similarities in the materials used for this fascicle and with Fascicles 11–13, 14, as well as Fascicles 9,11, and 12. Some distinct markers of Fascicle 13 include a woven-style of stationary, with paper that is cream in appearance with a blue rule line on it. It also is decorated in an embossed style that frames the page with "a queen's head above the letter 'L'." To view the holograph manuscript of this in person, the Houghton Library at Harvard University houses it.
166	In her analysis of the poem, scholar Helen Vendler, states that the opening foot of the poem is "reversed," adding more color and emphasis on the word "Hope." Dickinson implements the use of iambic meter for the duration of the poem to replicate that continuation of "Hope's song through time." Most of Dickinson's poetry contains quatrains and runs in a hymnal meter, which maintains the rhythm of alternating between four beats and three beats during each stanza. "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" is broken into three stanzas, each set alternating containing alternating lines of iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter, totaling in twelves lines altogether. In addition, despite Mr. Lin's theorizing, it is not actually about a bird.
167	The poem calls upon the imagery of seafaring adventures with the use of the word "Sea" and "Gale." Dickinson uses the metaphor of "Hope" being likened unto a bird that does not disappear when it encounters hardships or "storms." Vendler writes that Dickinson enjoys "the stimulus of teasing riddles," which is in use as she plays with the idea of "Hope" being a bird. Dickinson makes an allusion to "Hope" being something that does not disappear when the "Gale" and "storm" get worse and its song still sings on despite the intensity of whatever is attempting to unseat it. She also makes note that no matter what the speaker of the poem is doing, "Hope" does not leave even if they offer nothing in return to it.
168	Throughout the poem, Dickinson uses dashes liberally, ending nine lines out of twelve with them. In addition to the use of dashes, she employs capitalization of common nouns, such as "Hope," "Bird," and "Extremity." Scholar Ena Jung writes that Dickinson's dashes are among the most "widely contested diacriticals" in contemporary literary discussions. John Lennard, in his Poetry Handbook, states that Dickinson's poems rely heavily her use of dashes, capitalizations of particular words and her line/stanza breaks, with "'Hope' is the thing with feathers" falling into that categorization. He continues on stating that her "intense, [and] unexpected play" with her use of capitalization and dashes makes her poetry "memorable." When reading the poem aloud, the dashes create caesura, causing the brief poem to be read in a staccato'd rhythm. Jung claims that the use of Dickinson's dashes in her poetry creates a "visible breath" to the speaker that is delivering the poetry.
169	In her poem, Dickinson describes "hope" as a bird, which is being used as a metaphor for the idea of salvation. Dickinson has nine variations of the word "hope," which can be interpreted in multiple ways. Morgan writes that Dickinson often writes about birds when she is describing acts of worship, which coincides with the format of the hymn. Birds in Christian iconography are often represented as a dove. Dickinson uses many illusions to nature in her poems. Within this poem, she takes the image of the bird and the violence of weather to create a balance between the destructive and the beneficent. It is also a juxtaposition of the interior world and exterior, with the soul considered "interior" and the storms that attempt to dismantle hope being the "exterior."
170	Dickinson's poems are lauded as mysterious and enigmatic and typically have a volta, or turn in topic, at the end, such as "Because I could not stop for Death." "'Hope' is the thing with feathers," while possessing a similar quality, is considered "childlike" by some critics due to the simplicity of the work. Vendler expands on this idea by stating it is also due to the way that Dickinson constructs her poems in quatrains and hymnal meter, which can be seen as simplistic. Morgan argues that because of Dickinson's "antagonistic relation" she has with nineteenth-century Christianity, the poet gives a "reassessment of spirituality" through this poem by the use of the image of the bird and the Christian conception of "hope."
171	Hyla nicefori also known as the Colombian Backpack Frog, is a species of frog in the family Hylidae. It is endemic to the border region between Boyacá and Casanare in Colombia and only known from the holotype. The name format, as used by the American Museum of Natural History's Amphibian Species of the World, indicates that while this species is temporarily kept in the hylid type genus Hyla, it belongs elsewhere in the family and will be reassigned pending a taxonomic resolution. It was originally placed in Cryptobatrachus (backpack frogs), but a later study revealed a number morphological differences showing that it is not in family Hemiphractidae (the family of Cryptobatrachus), instead pointing to it being a hylid frog, perhaps Hyloscirtus.
172	"Hylarana" attigua is a species of frog in the family Ranidae, the "true frogs". The exact genus-level placement of this species is uncertain because it was not included in the revision of the genus Hylarana that saw what was then very broadly defined genus split into several distinct genera, with relatively few remaining in Hylarana sensu stricto. It is found in central and south Vietnam, eastern Cambodia, and southern Laos. The specific name attigua is derived from Latin attiguus meaning "neighbor". It refers to the similarity of this species to Indosylvirana milleti. Common name similar frog has been coined for this species.
173	Adult males measure 40–45 mm (1.6–1.8 in) and adult females 55–65 mm (2.2–2.6 in) in snout–vent length. The overall appearance is moderately stocky. The head is longer than it is broad and the snout is obtusely pointed, but rounded and projecting in lateral view. The tympanum is distinct, relatively larger in males than in females. The finger tips bear small discs. The toe discs are also small, but can be slightly larger than the fingers ones. The toes are partially webbed. There are conspicuous, continuous dorsolateral folds. Skin is dorsally granular with small tubercles, with larger tubercles on the sides. In many individuals, both males and females, the tubercles have white, spinose tips. Dorsal coloration is medium brown and may include small darker spots. A dark brown to black narrow band runs from the snout through the eye and the tympanum, becoming less defined in the temporal area. The upper lip has white to yellow stripe. The limbs have dark brown crossbars.
174	After being unceremoniously fired by California Fidelity Insurance, Kinsey has found herself new office space with her attorney, Lonnie Kingman. Lonnie has a case with which he wants Kinsey's help. Six years earlier, David Barney was acquitted of killing his estranged wife, talented but insecure society house-designer Isabelle Barney, by shooting her dead through the spy hole of her front door. David's desperation to rebuild the marriage after the split netted him an injunction for harassment; so he was the obvious suspect—particularly since he inherited Isabelle's multimillion-dollar business—but the prosecution could not make it stick. Now Isabelle's previous husband, Kenneth Voigt, is trying again in the civil courts in an attempt to secure the fortune for his and Isabelle's daughter Shelby; and Lonnie needs some evidence. The previous PI on the case, Morley Shine, has just died of a heart attack. Lonnie asks Kinsey to step in.
175	Kinsey agrees and, knowing Morley of old, is surprised to find his files in a mess, with crucial witness statements missing. One new witness has come forward: Curtis MacIntyre, a habitual jailbird who shared a cell with Barney for a night and claims that Barney confessed to his guilt just after the acquittal. Kinsey is very doubtful of this story, especially when she finds out Curtis was in custody on another matter on the date in question. In trying to fill in the other blanks, she uncovers more evidence in Barney's favor than against him, not least that Barney appears to have a cast-iron alibi; he was the victim of a hit and run whilst out jogging at the time of the murder some miles away. Kinsey tracks down both the driver—Tippy, the daughter of Isabelle's best friend Rhe Parsons—and a witness who can swear that she knocked down Barney.
176	Kinsey also finds out that Tippy, drunk and in her father's pick-up truck, was the perpetrator of a previous and fatal hit-and-run on the same night, the victim being an elderly man named Noah McKell. Kinsey realizes Morley was on the same track and begins to have suspicions about his death.  She eventually establishes that Morley was poisoned by a pastry left at his office, a pastry made with lethal mushrooms. She also finds out that Kenneth Voigt has been paying Curtis 'expense money' for years, which casts further doubt on his testimony. Curtis comes up with an alternative story: according to him, the confession was actually made some time after the acquittal during a drunken evening at Barney's home. This sounds even more unlikely to Kinsey's skeptical ears. She begins to suspect that someone else from Isabelle's immediate circle might be the guilty party—Isabelle's sister Simone, Ken Voigt's new wife Francesca, or Isabelle's former business partner Peter Weidmann and/or his wife Yolanda.
177	Back on the case, Kinsey has a sudden flash of inspiration after looking at the time gap between Tippy's killing Mr. McKell and knocking down Barney. Tippy admits that, panic-stricken after the first accident, she went to confess what she had done to her 'aunt' Isabelle but did not get an answer at the door. Kinsey realises Barney's alibi is worthless: having just killed Isabelle, he could have hitched on Tippy's pick-up and then rolled off it later at an appropriate time in front of witnesses, to establish his alibi miles away. Kinsey's train of thought is interrupted by a call from Curtis, asking her to meet him at the bird refuge. He sounds terrified, and Kinsey suspects he has been taken hostage. She arranges for Jonah, her ex-boyfriend cop, to provide back-up and calls in at the office to pick up her gun on the way. Barney has anticipated that she would do this and is waiting for her, along with Curtis's corpse. They play a cat-and-mouse version of Russian roulette with their respective guns until Kinsey, in possession of a gun with an extra round in the chamber, emerges victorious, having shot and killed Barney.
178	The "I AM" Movement is the original Ascended Master Teachings religious movement founded in the early 1930s by Guy Ballard (1878–1939) and his wife Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard (1886–1971) in Chicago, Illinois. It is an offshoot of theosophy and a major precursor of several New Age religions including the Church Universal and Triumphant. The movement had up to a million followers in 1938 and is still active today on a smaller scale. According to the official website of the parent organization, the Saint Germain Foundation, its worldwide headquarters is located in Schaumburg, Illinois, and there are approximately 300 local groups worldwide under several variations of the names "I AM" Sanctuary, "I AM" Temple, and other similar titles.  As of 2007, the organization states that its purpose is "spiritual, educational and practical," and that no admission fee is charged for their activities.  The term "I AM" is a reference to the ancient Sanskrit mantra "So Ham", meaning "I Am that I Am".
179	These "Ascended Masters" are believed to be humans who have lived in a succession of reincarnations in physical bodies or cosmic beings (beings originated from the great central sun of light in the beginning of all times). Over time, those who have passed through various “embodiments” became highly advanced souls, are able to move beyond the cycles of "re-embodiments" and karma, and attained their "Ascension", becoming immortal. The Ascended Masters are believed to communicate to humanity through certain trained messengers per Blavatsky, including Guy and Edna Ballard. Because Jesus is believed to be one of the Ascended Masters, making the "Christ Light" available to seekers who wish to move out of darkness, many of the members of the "I AM" Activity consider it to be a Christian religion. According to the Los Angeles Magazine, Ballard said he was the re-embodiment of George Washington, an Egyptian priest, and a noted French musician.
180	The Ballards said they began talking to the Ascended Masters regularly.  They founded a publishing house, Saint Germain Press, to publish their books and began training people to spread their messages across the United States.  These training sessions and "Conclaves" were held throughout the United States and were open to the general public and free of charge. A front-page story in a 1938 edition of the Chicago Herald and Examiner noted that the Ballards "do not take up collections or ask for funds". Some of the original members of I AM were recruited from the ranks of William Dudley Pelley’s organization the Silver Shirts. Meetings became limited to members only after hecklers began disrupting their open meetings.  Over their lifetimes, the Ballards recorded nearly 4,000 Live dictations, which they said were from the Ascended Masters.  Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and later his son Donald became the sole "Accredited Messengers" of the Ascended Masters.
181	The first of many "Conclaves" held in scores of cities in their national tours was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, October 10–19, 1934. According to a Los Angeles Magazine article, in August 1935, the Ballards hosted a gathering at the Shrine Auditorium  in Los Angeles that drew a crowd of 6,000. Guy Ballard spoke under the pseudonym he used in authoring his books, Godfre Ray King, and his wife used the pseudonym Lotus. The meeting included teachings they described as being received directly from the Ascended Masters. They led the audience in prayers and affirmations that they called decrees, including adorations to God and invocations for abundance of every good thing, including love, money, peace, and happiness.
182	Students of the "I Am" Activity believe in death as a change, not an ending. The "I AM" activity believe Ascension can mean Entering heaven alive, that is, to "raise one's body"—physically translating to a higher form of existence, as in the Ascension of Jesus.  This is what Guy Ballard had claimed his followers would be able to do if they followed his instructions.  Recorded in a dictation prior to Guy W Ballard's death a new dispensation to make the Ascension after the passing of death and cremation was given, and is recorded at the Saint Germain Foundation. Students using this more traditional definition would have to conclude that Mrs. Ballard did not tell the full teaching, since Mr. Ballard had died a quite ordinary death and his body had been cremated. There had also been questions raised about devout members who had died without entering heaven alive. At this time, Edna Ballard defined "Ascension" as dying an ordinary death, but going to a higher level of heaven than a normal person because one has balanced "51% of one's karma". This modified and more practical definition of "ascension" is used by all Ascended Master Teachings religions today, although they still believe that a select few, the higher level Ascended Masters such as Jesus and St. Germain, entered heaven alive.
183	In 1941, the Ballards were sued for copyright infringement by the family and estate of Frederick Spencer Oliver (1866-1899), "amenuensis" of the novel A Dweller on Two Planets, first published in 1905. The suit was dismissed for failure to state cause of action. District Judge Dawkins quoted the original foreword to Oliver's book in its entirety, wherein Oliver emphasized that he was not the author but had channeled the book from the spirit of a previously deceased person with the intent of preserving and conveying the story and teachings of that person's world; and the book had been copyrighted with Oliver as a proprietor, not as the author. Judge Dawkins pointed out that the Ballards had stated they were using similar methods to write their books and that this in itself wasn't enough to uphold the action in court.
184	Based on statements made in books sent via the mail, Edna Ballard and her son Donald were charged with eighteen counts of mail fraud in 1942. The presiding judge instructed the jury not to consider the truth or falsity of the religious beliefs, but only whether the Ballards sincerely believed the claims or did not, and the jury found them guilty. The Ninth Circuit overturned the conviction on the grounds that the judge improperly excluded the credibility of their religious beliefs from consideration, and the government appealed to the Supreme Court.  In United States v. Ballard, the Supreme Court in a 5-4 landmark decision held that the question of whether Ballards believed their religious claims should not have been submitted to the jury, and remanded the case back to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the fraud conviction.  Interpreting this decision, the Ninth Circuit later found that the Court did not go so far as to hold that "the validity or veracity of a religious doctrine cannot be inquired into by a Federal Court."
185	As of 2007, Saint Germain Foundation maintains a reading room in Mount Shasta, California, and its headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois.  Several annual conclaves are held at their 12-story "I AM Temple" at 176 West Washington Street in downtown Chicago.  Among the hundreds attending, there are usually dozens of "I AM" students from other nations.  Classes and conclaves are regularly held in approximately 300 locations in America, Europe, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. The Saint Germain Press, a subsidiary of the Saint Germain Foundation, publishes the historical books and related artwork and audio recordings of the Ballards' teachings, and a monthly magazine available by subscription, titled "The Voice of the 'I AM'". It has been estimated that the Saint Germain Press has printed and put into circulation over one million books.
186	The "I AM" Activity calls itself Christian, because Jesus is considered to be one of the more important Ascended Masters. It also refers to itself as patriotic because Ascended Master St. Germain is believed to have inspired and guided the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Followers claim that St. Germain belonged to the same Masonic Lodge as George Washington and Benjamin Franklin. However, Guy Ballard tended to downplay any relation of his ideas to Freemasonry because of his great discordance with Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a famous Freemason. Thus the notion that Saint-Germain belonged to a Masonic Lodge was more part of general occult lore than part of Ballard's emphasis.
187	The group teaches that the "Mighty I AM Presence" is God existing in and as each person's Higher Self, and that a light known as the "Violet Flame" is generated by the "I AM Presence" and may surround each person who calls forth the action of the Holy Spirit for expression of mercy or forgiveness. The group believes that by tapping into these internalized powers in accordance with the teachings of the Ascended Masters, one can use one's relationship to the "Presence" to amplify the expressions of virtue such as justice, peace, harmony, and love; to displace or abate the expression of evil (relative absence of good) in the world; and to minimize personal difficulties in one's life.
188	The spiritual goal of the teachings is that, through a process of self-purification, the believer may attain the perfected condition of the saints, or become an Ascended Master when leaving their body, contrasted to common concepts of 'ordinary death'. The process of attaining these results includes one or another of interior practices to facilitate resonance and alignment with the "I AM Presence": self-assessment in light of saintly exemplars such as Jesus, care in the use of language, devotion (to the Divine), gratitude, meditation, invocations and affirmations; and external practices such as "decrees" (repeated prayers given aloud with conviction), all of which are said to amplify the energetic presence of the divine in one's experience, resulting in the desired positive changes.Members believe there is actual science behind decrees and affirmations and claim these practices are acknowledged by medicine as effective.
189	It's not really that there is a "formula" for these things, but I have learned over the years that pretty much any successful musical you can name has an "I Want" song for its main character within the first fifteen or so minutes of the show. I can think of exceptions, but frankly, I feel that the lack of such a moment is a weakness in most of those cases. "Just Around the Riverbend" may not be a classic "I want" song, because the character doesn't really want anything that strongly until she meets John Smith, but it sets up her sense that she has another destiny to pursue than the one laid out for her by her father and society and her desire to go after it. The third number, "Mine Mine Mine", was basically supposed to introduce the antagonist, Ratcliffe, and what he wanted, so that the central dramatic conflict could be established.
190	In many cases, these songs literally include the words "I want", "I wish" or "I've got to". Classic examples include My Fair Lady's "Wouldn't It Be Loverly", Carnival's "Mira", The Sound of Music's "I Have Confidence", Wicked's "The Wizard and I", The Book of Mormon's "You and Me (But Mostly Me)", Hamilton's "My Shot" and "The Room Where It Happens", The Producers' "King of Broadway" and Dear Evan Hansen's "Waving Through a Window." Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine's 1986 Broadway musical Into the Woods begins and ends with a character saying "I wish". For earlier examples, see "Over the Rainbow" from The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) or "It Might as Well Be Spring" from State Fair (1945 film).
191	The Walt Disney Company has a long tradition of "I Want" songs in Disney animated musicals going back to the Disney Renaissance era. The term has retroactively been used to describe older "I Want" songs. In a top ten list of Disney, The Daily Dot ranked Robin Hood's "Not in Nottingham" as the best "I Want" song. The site also noted that these could be sung by antagonists, ranking The Hunchback of Notre Dame's "Hellfire" at number 5. FanPop listed "Part of Your World" from The Little Mermaid as the best song of this type. The WFPL article Great 'I Want' Moments in Musicals listed "Belle", "Somewhere That's Green", "Wouldn't It Be Loverly", "Lonely Room", "Corner of the Sky", and "Part of Your World".
192	An "I quit" match is a type of professional wrestling match in which the only way to win is to make the opponent say the words "I quit" (usually into a microphone). It is a variation of submission match as it can only be won by submission, but it is special in that the submission has to take the form of the forfeiting opponent saying "I quit". Generally, whenever a wrestler knocks down their opponent with a move or inflicts a submission move, the opponent will be asked—either by the referee or the opponent—to say the words into a microphone. "I quit" matches are commonly used to settle kayfabe grudges and embarrass rivals since saying "I quit" is usually a sign of admitted inferiority.
193	One of the most famous "I quit" matches took place on January 24, 1999 at the Royal Rumble between The Rock and Mick Foley (as Mankind) in the World Wrestling Federation. The match lasted just over 20 minutes, ending after Foley took eleven unprotected chair shots to the head while his hands were handcuffed behind his back. The Rock eventually won the match, but it was later revealed that Foley was completely unconscious and The Rock had played a tape of Foley saying "I quit" over the public address system. The following night on Raw, The Rock's "I quit!" match against Triple H ended when Triple H was extorted into saying "I quit" because Kane was about to chokeslam Chyna. John Cena retained his WWE Championship by defeating John Bradshaw Layfield in an "I quit" match at Judgment Day on May 22, 2005. At Breaking Point on September 13, 2009, Cena defeated his long time rival Randy Orton in an "I quit" match, forcing Orton to say "I quit" while he was handcuffed and Cena simultaneously had applied his submission hold, the STF.
194	John Lyle, a junior army officer under the Prophet, is stationed at the Prophet's capital of New Jerusalem. He had been devout, but he finds himself questioning his faith when he falls for one of the Prophet's Virgins, Sister Judith. New to the vocation, Judith faints when she is called upon to render sexual service to the Prophet and is confined to her quarters until she sees the light. John confides in his far more worldly roommate, Zeb Jones, who is not shocked but even assists John. A clandestine meeting with Judith goes awry when they are forced to kill a spy. They are left with no choice but to seek aid from the Cabal, an underground revolutionary movement (Judith's friend, Sister Magdalene, is a member). The two men are inducted into the Cabal while they remain on duty in their army posts. Judith is arrested and tortured as part of the investigation into the death of the spy, and John and Zeb rescue her but leave enough clues that John is soon arrested and tortured himself. He gives little away and is himself rescued by the Cabal. Zeb and Magdalene have evaded arrest thanks to a clandestine distress signal that John manages to leave for Zeb while he is arrested.
195	While set in Heinlein's Future History, the story is self-contained and has little connection with other works in the series. However, it is noted in Methuselah's Children that, during the time of this story, the secret of the Howard Families was held close (being a prize that was beyond the power of the Prophet to confiscate), and also that the Cabal assisted in helping the Howards maintain their Masquerade, the concealment of the existence of the Howards. Lazarus Long specifically mentions that he spent the period of the Interregnum, when the Prophets ruled the United States and space travel was forbidden, mostly on Venus.
196	Scudder was previously mentioned in passing in the short story "Logic of Empire" and later on in Heinlein's final novel To Sail Beyond the Sunset. A story about the rise of Scudder, "The Sound of His Wings", is contained in the Future History timeline, but was never written by Heinlein, who stated in the afterword to Revolt in 2100: "I will probably never write the story of Nehemiah Scudder, I dislike him too much". Also, a story called "The Stone Pillow", which would have depicted the earlier foredoomed opposition to the Theocracy, never got written, Heinlein noting that there was "too much tragedy in real life".
197	In chapter 9 of Germania, Tacitus, employing interpretatio romana (a process in which what an author deems Roman equivalents are listed in place of non-Roman deity names), says that the Suebi principally venerate "Mercury", and that they regard it as sacral to offer him both human and non-human sacrifices on specific dates (unprovided). The Suebi also worship "Mars" and "Hercules", who they appease by offering animals in a traditional manner. Tacitus adds that a part of the Suebi, however, venerate "Isis", although he admits that he doesn't know how worship of Isis could have been imported:
198	While Tacitus's "Mercury", "Mars", and "Hercules" are generally held to refer to Odin, Tyr, and Thor respectively, the identity of "Isis" has been a matter of debate. In his translation of Germania, scholar J. B. Rives comments that while, in Tacitus's time, the cult of Isis was widespread and is well attested in provinces on the border of Germania, Tacitus's identification is problematic because the cult of Isis seems to have spread with Greco-Roman culture. Rives comments that "most scholars believe that Tacitus has misidentified a native Germanic ritual that bore some resemblance to a well-known Isiac ritual that involved a ship [...]".
199	The case Mac hires Kinsey to investigate is that of Wendell Jaffe, assumed to have died five years previously when his boat, the Captain Stanley Lord, was found drifting off the Baja coast. He left behind a suicide note, a number of creditors who had invested in what turned out to be a Ponzi scheme, and a family:  a wife, Dana, along with sons Michael and Brian.  It seemed certain Jaffe had killed himself to avoid the disgrace and jail sentence, which fell instead to his business partner, Carl Eckert. But with no body to prove death, CFI made Dana wait the full statutory five years to presume death before paying out on Jaffe's half-million insurance claim; and she has been making ends meet by working as a wedding planner. Michael, now 22, has coped reasonably well with suddenly being the man of the house and is a new husband and father himself. Eighteen-year-old Brian, on the other hand, is in a mess, currently residing in juvenile hall.
200	Two months after the insurance money was finally paid, a former colleague of Mac's has spotted a man he is convinced is Jaffe in Viento Negro, Mexico. Mac hires Kinsey to go there and check it out. After a little hotel room breaking and entering, she finds Wendell is now known as Dean DeWitt Huff, travelling with a woman called Renata Huff, who has a residence on the quays in Perdido, near Santa Teresa, as well as a boat of her own.  Before Kinsey can prove his identity, they skip out; on the same day, Brian is arrested in the middle of a botched escape attempt in which a female motorist, as well as his three conspirators, are killed. Kinsey is convinced Wendell will be heading back to California to reconnect with his son.
201	Doing a door-to-door back in California, Kinsey is astonished to be asked if she is related to the Burton Kinsey family of Lompoc, as she looks so like them.  Kinsey denies the connection but undertakes a little detective work on her behalf and is amazed to find her mother's father was indeed Burton Kinsey.  Far from being family-less, Kinsey has cousins, aunts and a grandmother living less than an hour away. Her cousin Liza shows up to tell her the family scandal: Kinsey's mother was cut off from her family for marrying Kinsey's father. Kinsey is aghast that no one has tried to track her down in the 29 years since her parents were killed and is resentful of any intrusion into her solitude at this late date.
202	Her thoughts are dragged back to the case at hand when through an apparent police clerical error, Brian is suddenly released from prison. Kinsey is certain Wendell has engineered it and is planning to slip through her fingers again with Brian. Renata catches Kinsey red-handed searching on her property but when Kinsey turns the tables (and her own gun) on her, Renata admits Wendell is visiting Michael. At last, Kinsey has tracked Jaffe down, but her success is short lived when someone takes potshots at them both and Wendell escapes once more. The day after, the Captain Stanley Lord, where Eckert has been living for the past few years, also goes missing while Eckert is away; and when it's found drifting uninhabited a few miles off-shore, there's a distinct sense of deja-vu about Wendell's disappearance.
203	Nevertheless, it's enough for CFI: Kinsey has proved Jaffe didn't die and therefore the insurance money can be reclaimed from Dana. But Kinsey is dissatisfied—she wants the truth and is prepared to pursue it on her own time. She finds Brian, and also finds out from Eckert that there was three million dollars from their fraudulent business scheme on board the missing boat. Renata confesses that she killed Wendell, dumped his body at sea, and then set the Lord adrift, making her way back to shore in her own dinghy. She then wades out into the sea to kill herself, and Kinsey is unable to stop her.
204	Kinsey Millhone is hired by Janice Kepler to investigate the death of her daughter, Lorna Kepler. Lorna had been found dead and badly decomposed ten months earlier in her lonely cabin home.  The police at the time suspected it might have been a murder case, but from lack of evidence as to cause of death, the official line was that Lorna died naturally, as a result of an allergic reaction. Now someone has sent Janice a tape of a porn movie Lorna apparently made before her death, and Janice, who has coped badly with her daughter's death, wants Kinsey to find out the truth. Mace, Janice's husband, and her two surviving daughters, Berlyn and Trinny, seem less keen on the investigation, and Mace and Berlyn, in particular, become positively hostile to Kinsey as she sets out to find out what happened to Lorna.
205	With some help from Officer Cheney Phillips, Kinsey quickly learns that Lorna, who was a receptionist at the water treatment plant by day, had accumulated a modest fortune as a high class prostitute by night. Lorna was a beautiful loner, but had some friends - mainly people who like her tended to be up and about at night.  Kinsey finds herself having to abandon her usual day-time routine in order to get herself into Lorna's world.  Lorna's body was found by Serena Bonney, night-shift nurse and estranged wife of Lorna's boss at the water treatment plant, Roger Bonney. Serena's father, Clark Esselmann, is a powerful business tycoon with a number of enemies. She also befriends Danielle, a teenage colleague of Lorna's in her night-time occupation, who obliges Kinsey by giving her a badly needed haircut.  When Danielle is savagely attacked in her home, Kinsey becomes convinced there's a link to Lorna's death, and her quest to discover the truth becomes more personal. Meanwhile, Kinsey has a terrifying Mafia-style encounter with a man describing himself as an attorney for a Los Angeles man to whom Lorna was engaged. He asks Kinsey to keep him abreast of any developments in the case by giving her a telephone number.
206	Kinsey soon uncovers a variety of secrets:  Berlyn actually discovered Lorna's body, but kept quiet about in order to lift some of Lorna's money, and also sent her mother the porn video.  Leda, the wife of Lorna's landlord, JD, had bugged Lorna's cabin because she was worried (needlessly, as it turned out) that Lorna and JD were having an affair - and still has the tape. With the help of Lorna's friend, late-night radio DJ Hector Mereno, Kinsey transcribes a phone conversation Lorna had before her death which seems to have upset Lorna, but she can't make sense of it until Clark Esselmann is electrocuted in his swimming pool. Kinsey realizes that the conversation on the tape is someone telling Lorna the plot - and surmises that having objected to it, Lorna was killed so that the plot could still be carried out.  Her suspicions turn to Stubby Stockton, a business opponent of Esselmann's, and to Roger Bonney, since Kinsey now knows, from Berlyn's admission of the discovery of the body, that Lorna was already dead when Roger claimed he spoke to her for the last time.  He is also the one with the necessary knowledge and access to his father-in-law's pool to have set up the electrocution. The final link in the chain is when Kinsey, in the course of cleaning up Danielle's trashed apartment while she's still in hospital, finds a photo of Lorna and Danielle with Stockton and Bonney.
207	Kinsey talks to Cheney about her suspicions of Roger, but he points out there is no evidence.  Frustrated that Bonney is likely to get away with murder, Kinsey is further infuriated by learning that Danielle has died in hospital. Impulsively, she phones the secret number and reports that Bonney is the killer. Overcome with guilt, she immediately tries to warn him, but he misunderstands, thinking she has come to confront him with the murder, and stuns her with a tazer. While Kinsey lies powerless on the floor, the Mafia types arrive and escort Bonney away.
208	In 1920 an act of the United States Congress established "Hawaii National Park" (later split into Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and Haleakalā National Park), shining a spotlight on the islands.  The 1920s became a heydey for all things Hawaiian, including novelty acts of the vaudeville genre.  Among Nawahi's novelty stunts was playing Turkey in the Straw on Hawaiian guitar with his feet.  Tin Pan Alley went with the Hawaii craze and between 1915 and 1929 produced such ditties as Hello Hawaii How Are You? (1915) (when many pronounced the state's name as How-Wah-Yah), Oh How She Could Yacki Hacki Wiki Wacki Woo (1916), Hula Hula Dream Girl (1924) and That Aloha Waltz (1928).
209	Kinsey is asked by her landlord Henry Pitts to help out Bucky, the grandson of their recently deceased neighbor Johnny Lee. Bucky is trying to ensure his grandfather has a military burial. Ray Rawson and Gilbert Hays, old acquaintances of Johnny Lee, turn up unexpectedly and are interested in the meager contents of Johnny's garage apartment. The two are at cross-purposes, seeking the proceeds of a bank robbery they committed together with Johnny forty years ago. Gilbert, a violent psychopath, pursues Ray, Kinsey and Laura Huckaby (Ray's daughter and Gilbert's common-law wife) from Santa Teresa to Dallas, TX to Louisville, KY, in search of the money buried in a secret location by Johnny before his death. Catching up with them in Louisville, Gilbert takes Laura hostage to force Ray and Kinsey to piece together Johnny's clues and find the stash. Gilbert, intending to double-cross Ray after it is found, finds himself double-crossed by Ray, who had surreptitiously disabled his firearm. Shooting Gilbert dead to avenge all the deaths he is responsible for, including their associates from the heist, Ray escapes into hiding with Laura after she knocks Kinsey unconscious to keep her from following them.
210	"Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder (Russian: Детская болезнь "левизны" в коммунизме, Detskaya Bolezn' "Levizny" v Kommunizme) is a work by Vladimir Lenin attacking assorted critics of the Bolsheviks who claimed positions to their left. Most of these critics were proponents of ideologies later described as left communism. The book was written in 1920 and published in Russian, German, English and French later in the year. A copy was then distributed to each delegate at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern, several of whom were mentioned by Lenin in the work. The book is divided into ten chapters and an appendix.
211	Lenin points out that the Russian Revolution has considerable international significance and criticises the leaders of the Second International, including Karl Kautsky, for failing to recognize the international relevance of soviet power as a revolutionary model. To illustrate their move away from revolutionary politics, he supplies a quote from a 1902 work of Kautsky which concludes that "Western Europe is becoming a bulwark of reaction and absolutism in Russia". Lenin asserts that in a war against the bourgeoisie "iron discipline" is an "essential condition". He then describes the circumstances which led the Bolsheviks to this conclusion in their success at taking state power in Russia.
212	Lenin critiques the Workers Socialist Federation's opposition to parliamentary action and in particular to affiliation to the Labour Party through texts written by Sylvia Pankhurst and Willie Gallacher. He proposes that all the main socialist groups in the country should form a Communist Party of Great Britain and that they should offer an electoral coalition with Labour. He concludes that the party would gain whether or not Labour accepted the offer. In a famous turn of phrase, he says that they should support Labour General Secretary Arthur Henderson "in the same way as the rope supports a hanged man".
213	It has taught me a great deal, as all your writings have done. [...] Many a trace, and many a germ of this infantile disease, to which without a doubt, I also am a victim, has been chased away by your brochure, or will yet be eradicated by it. Your observations about the confusion that revolution has caused in many brains, is quite right too. I know that. The revolution came so suddenly, and in a way so utterly different from what we expected. Your words will be an incentive to me, once again, and to an even greater extent than before, to base my judgement in all matters of tactics, also in the revolution, exclusively on reality, on the actual class-relations, as they manifest themselves politically and economically.
214	"Litoria castanea" is a member of the Litoria aurea complex, being distinguished by cream markings on its thighs. The overall colour is pale green and the dark to black spots are highlighted by the bronze patches. The toes are entirely webbed, the species favouring permanent water bodies. The reasons behind its drastic decline are unclear, but the disease chytridiomycosis is suspected to have played a major role. No recorded sighting had been made since 1980, and the species was believed to be extinct. However, in late 2009 New South Wales Fisheries field scientist Luke Pearce located a surviving population of the frogs.  Scientists acted quickly to establish a small "insurance" colony.  Soon after, the wild colony was eradicated due to two consecutive floods and an outbreak of chytrid fungus.  Following a breeding program at Sydney's Taronga Zoo, in early 2018 a colony of yellow-spotted bell frogs were released in a secret location in the New South Wales southern tablelands.
215	"Lockkeeper's" House is a historic building located south of Eldon along the Des Moines River in Davis County, Iowa, United States. More specifically it is located in Section 1 of Salt Creek Township. Local legend associates this stone house with the Des Moines River Improvement Project, which was conceived to build a lock and dam system along the Des Moines River to make it navigable from the Mississippi River to the Raccoon River at Des Moines. Historically, the resource was situated at this location for access and control over the river locks proposed to be built at Eldon. With the failure of the Des Moines River Navigation Company the project failed in the early 1841's. Built in 1845 the Lockkeeper's House consists of a 13⁄4 story, end gabled, solid masonry building. The building served only as a residence having never been used for the locks, which were never built. It has a two-over-two room plan and a masonry central dividing wall with a built in chimney. While local legend may not be accurate, the 13⁄4-story structure is a fine example of mid-19th century vernacular architecture. The house is unique in that limestone was rarely used in residential construction in this part of Iowa. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009.
216	In January 1986, Tasha Howard hires her cousin Kinsey Millhone to find an heir of the wealthy Malek family. When patriarch Bader Malek died, everyone assumed his $40 million estate would be split between his sons: Donovan, who runs the Malek construction empire; Bennet, a would-be entrepreneur; and Jack, a playboy. However, the will also names the supposedly disinherited second son Guy, the black sheep of the family who left home 18 years ago and whom the family has not seen or heard from since. His unlikeable brothers do not want him back in their lives, nor do they want his taking a cut of the inherited millions. Kinsey sympathizes with the story of Guy's exile from his family, as she struggles to deal with her own family troubles.
217	With illicit help from Darcy Pascoe, a friend at California Fidelity Insurance, Kinsey tracks Guy to the small town of Marcella near Santa Teresa. After being rescued by local pastor Peter Antle and his wife Winnie, Guy has become a devout Christian and turned his life around. Kinsey finds him the nicest of the Malek brothers. Despite Kinsey's warnings, Guy agrees to return to his childhood home. Ugly family scenes ensue. Kinsey's worst fears for Guy are exceeded when he is found brutally bludgeoned to death at the family home. Feeling guilty for his death, Kinsey tries to find his killer.
218	Initial physical evidence implicates Jack Malek in Guy's murder; and his attorney, Lonnie Kingman, hires Kinsey to investigate further for Jack's defense. Kinsey believes the crime's motive lies in the past but can't reconcile Guy's misdemeanors with the character of the man she knew. She decides Guy was a scapegoat for crimes he didn't commit: for example, Guy supposedly swindled widow Mrs. Maddison out of a fortune in valuable historical documents, alongside getting daughter Patti pregnant. Kinsey discovers that Bennet and his university friend Paul Trasatti completed the crime under the name Maxwell Outhwaite, a pseudonym constructed from two adjacent books, after the fashion of Conan Edogawa. She also connects the name to the murder to the Maddison family; but since Patty Maddison's mother, her sister Claire, and other family have died, this appears to be a frustrating dead end.
219	Dietz discovers that the story of Claire's death has been faked. Meanwhile, Enid reports that Myrna has disappeared from the Malek home in circumstances suggestive of foul play. Kinsey realizes that Myrna is actually Claire, having bided her time to get revenge on the Malek family and Guy in particular. Claire tries to escape on foot; but Kinsey catches her and confronts her with her crime against Guy, the blameless brother. After confessing to destroying the will that disinherited Guy and confessing to the murder itself, Claire commits suicide. In a post-script, Kinsey explains that Tasha used a note Guy wrote to Kinsey as evidence of testamentary to ensure his share of the Malek millions goes to Peter and Winnie's church. The book ends with Kinsey's reconciling her grief at losing Guy, just as she once had to do with her deceased parents and aunt.
220	Whiddett has also competed in off-road racing. In 2015, he participated in the Stadium Super Trucks race at the Sand Sports Super Show, an opportunity he received after meeting series founder Robby Gordon at the Goodwood Festival of Speed. He drove E. J. Viso's No. 5 truck during the weekend, with points earned by Whiddett going to Viso in the championship. After starting second for the first race, he finished fourth; this was followed by a retirement in Race 2 with an engine problem. Although he rolled in the final race, he finished seventh.
221	"Major" John Buchanan (born January 12, 1759) was an American frontiersman and one of the founders of present-day Nashville, Tennessee.  He is best known for defending his fort, Buchanan Station, from an attack by several hundred Native American Indians on September 30, 1792. The defense at Buchanan's Station saved early Nashville, which was unprepared after dismissing rumors of an incoming Indian onslaught.  On their part, the Indians recoiled, splitting into small parties that caused considerable damage to outlying homesteads but abandoned the major attack on Nashville. Nor was any like invasion attempted again. The defense of Buchanan's Station not only spared Nashville, but raised the morale of the pioneers at a dark and difficult time, and was frequently recalled in the following decades as a symbol of the courage and determination of the founders of the state of Tennessee.
222	Major Buchanan's roots can be traced to Anselan O Kyan, the son of the King of Ulster Dermond O Kyan of Ireland and the founder of the Buchanan clan.  Anselan fled Ireland and landed on the northern coast of Argyll, Scotland near The Lennox north of the present day city of Glasgow, around the year 1016.   Anselan assisted Malcolm II of Scotland in repelling his old enemies, the Danes, on two different occasions.  Anselan received a grant of land in the north of Scotland, East of Loch Lomond. The Buchanan name bears a unique Coat of Arms and specific war cry granted to Anselan.
223	At the time, Nashville consisted of only about sixty families, and it was isolated in a hostile and threatening wilderness.  Communications with the nearest settlements, Knoxville in eastern Tennessee and Natchez further south on the Mississippi, were long and precarious.  Although the ultimate responsibility for the area had been transferred from North Carolina to the United States federal government in 1790, neither entity had the will or resources to offer the small outpost effective protection.  Ranged against it were Native Americans, understandably aggrieved at the loss of traditional territory, and international powers. Threatened by the rise of the new American republic, Britain and Spain both encouraged Indian confederacies to resist its expansion and create a buffer between it and their own colonial possessions.  North of the Ohio, the British saw Indians as an essential part of the defense of Canada, while Baron Carondelet, the governor of Spanish territory south of the 31st parallel and west of the Mississippi, armed the southern Indians and urged them to unite against the Americans.  It was time, one Spanish correspondent wrote, to “place an obstacle to the rapid western progress of the Americans and raise a barrier between these enterprising people and the Spanish possessions.” In these circumstances the positions of isolated American pioneer settlements was unenviable, and in 1792 Bledsoe's and Ziegler's stations north of Nashville were overrun by parties of Indians smaller than the one that attacked Buchanan's later in the year.
224	The assault on Buchanan's Station was not a simple raid, but an attempt to wipe out the Nashville settlements entirely, backed by Spanish arms and supplies secured in Pensacola.  Over three hundred Lower Cherokees, Creeks, and Shawnees under the command of a mixed blood Cherokee leader named John Watts, advanced on Nashville from their towns on the lower Tennessee River.  Supposing that the outlying station of Buchanan could be disposed of quickly, the Indians attempted a surprise attack at midnight.  The station contained only a handful of defenders, some fifteen men, who manned the port-holes while their women and children—led by Buchanan's wife—molded bullets, reloaded muskets and rifles, and supplied sustenance.  During a furious fight, the Indians attempted to storm the palisade and to set fire to the roof of the blockhouse, but they were repelled within two hours.
225	It was during this nighttime "Battle of Buchanan's Station" that Buchanan's eighteen-year-old wife, Sarah ("Sally") Ridley Buchanan, in her ninth month of pregnancy with the first of their thirteen children, earned national fame.  She encouraged the men, reassured the women and children, molded much-needed ammunition reportedly by melting down her dinnerware, and provided the voice of victory throughout the seemingly hopeless pandemonium.   For her uncommon valor, she was known as the "Heroine of Buchanan Station" and biographer Elizabeth Ellet referred to her as “the Greatest Heroine of the West.” Sally was heralded in magazines and newspapers as well as listed in at least two national encyclopedias of biography (Appleton's and Herringshaw's).
226	"Master Harold"...and the boys is a play by Athol Fugard.  Set in 1950, it was first produced at the Yale Repertory Theatre in March 1982 and made its premiere on Broadway on 4 May at the Lyceum Theatre, where it ran for 344 performances. The play takes place in South Africa during apartheid era, and depicts how institutionalized racism, bigotry or hatred can become absorbed by those who live under it. It is said to be a semi-autobiographical play, as Athol Fugard's birth name was Harold and his boyhood was very similar to Hally's, including his father being disabled, and his mother running a tea shop to support the family. His relationship with his family's servants was similar to Hally's as he sometimes considered them his friends, but other times treated them like subservient help, insisting that he be called "Master Harold", and once spitting in the face of one he had been close to.
227	At the start of the play, Sam and Willie are practising ballroom steps in preparation for a major competition while maintaining the tea shop. Business is slow due to the rain. Sam is revealed as being the more worldly of the two. When Willie, in broken English, describes his ballroom partner and girlfriend as lacking enthusiasm, Sam correctly diagnoses the problem: Willie beats her if she doesn't know the steps. Willie, in turn, claims he has no romantic feelings left for her, he suspects she's cheating on him regularly, and their baby child, for whom he's paying child support, isn't really his.
228	Hally then arrives home from school, and cheerfully asks if the two are ready for the competition. Sam is the unacknowledged yet de facto mentor to the boy since childhood and always has treated Hally as his nephew/ward. Sam hopes to skillfully guide Hally through the difficult passage from childhood into manhood. Willie, for his part, has always played the "loyal black"; who always called the white Afrikaner boy (now young man) Master Harold. Willie is a man of 45, and has been addressing Hally as a superior since the latter was age six.
229	The conversation among the three moves includes Hally's school-work; an intellectual discussion on "A Man of Magnitude", where they mention various historical figures of the time and their contribution to society; flashbacks of Hally, Sam and Willie when they lived in a boarding house. Hally warmly remembers the simple act of flying a kite Sam had made for him out of junk; we later learn that Sam made it to cheer Hally up after he was embarrassed greatly by his father's public and continuing drunkenness. Hally wishes the story had a more interesting ending, as it ended simply with Hally sitting on a bench to watch the kite fly while Sam quietly went back to work. Conversation then turns to Hally's 500-word English composition. The play reaches an emotional apex as the beauty of the ballroom dancing floor ("a world without collisions") is used as a metaphor for life. Willie would like to play the juke box for further demonstration, but only has enough money for bus fare.
230	Almost immediately despair returns: Sam earlier mentioned why Hally's mother is not present; the hospital had called about his father, who has been there receiving treatment for complications from a leg he lost in World War II, to discharge him, and she had left to bring him home. However, Hally, indicating that his father had been in considerable pain the previous day, insisted that his father wasn't well enough to be discharged and that the call must've been about a bad turn rather than a discharge notice. A call from Hally's mother at the hospital confirms that Hally's father is manipulating the hospital into discharging him. He is indeed, not feeling any better than before, so it's still unofficial, and Hally remains hopeful that the discharge won't happen. A second call from Hally's mother later reveals that the discharge is official, and Hally's father is now home.
231	Hally is distraught about this news because his father, who in addition to being crippled, is revealed to be a tyrannical alcoholic, and his being home will make home life unbearable with his drinking, fighting, and need for continuous treatment, which includes demeaning tasks of having to massage his stump and empty chamber pots full of phlegm and urine. Hally vents to his two black friends years of anger and pain, viciously mocking his father and his condition. When Sam chastises him for doing so, Hally, although ashamed of himself, turns on him, unleashing vicarious racism, that he learned from his father, creating possibly permanent rifts in his relationship with both Sam and Willie. For the first time, apart from hints throughout the play, Hally begins explicitly to treat Sam and Willie as subservient help rather than as friends or playmates, insisting that Sam call him Master Harold and spitting on him. Sam is hurt and angry, and both he and Willie stop just short of attacking Hally, but they both come to understand that Hally is really causing himself the most pain.
232	There is a glimmer of hope for reconciliation at the end when Sam addresses Hally by his nickname again and asks to start over the next day, harkening back to the simple days of the kite. Hally, horrified about what he's done, is barely able to face Sam, responding without looking up "It's still raining, Sam. You can't fly kites on rainy days, remember," and asks Willie to lock up the tea shop. Just as Hally leaves, Sam gives him an interesting ending to the kite story: The bench Hally sat on as he flew the kite said "Whites Only" but Hally was too young and excited to notice it at the time, and he can (figuratively) leave it at any time. Hally leaves the shop without response. The play ends with Willie giving up his bus fare to play the juke box, and he and Sam consoling each other by ballroom dancing together.
233	The title was given to mothers who had given birth, raised and educated 8 children or more in the spirit of socialist patriotism, with a love for work, with a sense of putting the general interest above their own, who were activists and had good working achievements.This title was given to mothers when the children were alive and the youngest had reached the age of 1 year old. Children who were martyred during the National Liberation War or disappeared because of it and who did not have a bad political profile, as well as children who died in the line of duty for the national interest are counted as if they were alive.
234	A group of vigilantes calling themselves "Muslim patrols" patrolled the streets in East London from 2013 to 2014. The individuals were young Sunni Muslim men, members of an organisation that called itself the "Shariah Project". Early in 2013, videos of their activities, filmed by members of the patrol, were uploaded online: these showed hooded members confronting passers-by and demanding that they behave in an Islamic way. They targeted prostitutes, people drinking alcohol, couples who were holding hands, women whom they considered to be dressed immodestly, and harassed others whom they perceived as being gay. Five men were arrested in January 2013 as part of an investigation into the gang. In December 2013, three of them pleaded guilty to affray, and were subsequently jailed.
235	The Central Criminal Court heard evidence concerning incidents involving the patrol which took place in Shoreditch, Bethnal Green, and outside the East London Mosque where videos were made of members of the patrol harassing members of the public at night when the mosque was closed. The patrol targeted a heterosexual couple in Bethnal Green for holding hands, shouting at them to stop because they were in "a Muslim area." Just weeks later, the patrol picked on five friends who were drinking in the street because it was "Allah's land"; 19-year-old Islamic convert Jordan Horner threatened to stab the men, while one of the patrol members shouted "kill the non-believers".
236	Three of the patrol members were convicted in November, and were sentenced on 6 December 2013. Jordan Horner, who uses the Islamic name Jamaal Uddin, pleaded guilty to two charges of assault and two charges of using threatening words and behaviour, and was sentenced to 68 weeks imprisonment. Thirty-six-year-old Ricardo MacFarlane who pleaded not guilty, was sentenced to one year for affray and two years for using threatening words and behaviour. 23-year-old Royal Barnes, who was awaiting further trial regarding offensive videos about Lee Rigby and therefore could not be named at the time, pleaded guilty and received a six-month sentence for affray.
237	"My Roots Are Showing..." is The Fourth Studio Album by American country singer–songwriter K. T. Oslin. It was released on October 1, 1996 via BNA Records and contained ten tracks. The album was co-produced by Oslin and Rick Will. The project contained cover versions of songs first made famous in the country and pop fields. It was Oslin's first studio album release in six years after experiencing personal setbacks. "My Roots Are Showing..." reached peak positions on the country albums chart following its release. It would also spawn two singles issued to country radio in 1996.
238	Oslin was also contemplating a musical comeback. RCA Records executive Joe Galante had offered her a position in the A&R department, but she ultimately declined. Instead, Oslin told Galante about the possibility of recording a dance-flavored country album. However, she was reluctant about the concept and ultimately abandoned the idea when meeting with Nashville writer Robert K. Oermann. Together, the pair found songs that would make up "My Roots Are Showing..". Oslin later stated the album's "roots" came from music that influenced her as a recording artist and performer: bluegrass, folk and blues.
239	Oermann and Oslin collected ten songs that would make up the album's track listing. She had first found the songs "Down in the Valley" and "Hold Whatcha Got" before finishing finding the remainder of the album's material. All of the album's tracks were covers of songs first made popular by other music artists and writers. Among these songs was Webb Pierce's "Pathway of Teardrops" and Irving Berlin's "I'll See You in C-U-B-A." The album's eventual lead single, "Silver Tongue and Goldplated Lies" was a cover of the original recording by Jan Howard in 1983. Her version had also been a single and released on her studio effort, Tainted Love.
240	According to Bill Carpenter of Allmusic, the album's material was a mix of dance, rock and blues. For example, Carpenter commented that "Hold Whatcha Got" "rocks so hard it could have shot straight from the Jerry Lee Lewis songbook." Oslin later brought in engineer Rick Will to help with production. Will helped find Nashville session players to perform on the project. In an 1996 interview, Oslin spoke highly of the album's session players: "The songs and the players are the real stars here. I think everyone will copy the sounds on this record." "My Roots Are Showing..." was recorded at Woodland Studios, located in Nashville, Tennessee. Both Oslin and Will served as the project's co-producers, according to the liner notes.
241	"My Roots Are Showing..." was released on October 1, 1996 on BNA Records. It was Oslin's fourth studio album released in her career. The album was originally issued as both a compact disc and a cassette. It would later be released to digital retailers, including Apple Music. Following its original 1996 release, Joe Galante believed the album to be radio-friendly and for it to perform well on the charts. However, "My Roots Are Showing..." only spent six weeks on the Billboard Top Country Albums and reached a peak position of 45 on the list in October 1996. The record was Oslin's lowest-charting album in the United States. Radio directors were drawn to Oslin's cover of "Silver Tongue and Goldplated Lies," which ultimately prompted her record label to release it as its first single. The single was released via BNA Records in July 1996. Yet after five weeks on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, it only reached a peak position of 64.
242	"My Roots Are Showing..." received mixed reviews from writers and critics following its release. In their October 1996 issue, Billboard magazine called the album "eclectic Americana" in response to the album's array of musical styles. "She's rearranged everything in her own, quirky style, and the result is a body of related work that would play just as well at the Rainbow Room as on a Mississippi riverboat," they commented. Meanwhile, Allmusic's Bill Carpenter only gave the project 2.5 out of 5 stars. While he called all of the songs to be "a gem," he also found the album to lack a marketing direction: "The only issue is that this was marketed as a country album when the Nashville element isn't terribly conspicuous."
243	The story takes place mainly in the small-town mountain community of Nota Lake, California (population 2,356, elevation 4,312), where Kinsey has inherited a client named Selma Newquist from her periodic boyfriend Robert Dietz. He is temporarily out of action back home in Carson City, where Kinsey has been taking care of him following knee surgery. Selma's brief is vague: she fears her husband Tom, a sheriff's officer who died of a heart attack a few weeks before, had something on his mind at the time of his death; and she wants Kinsey to find out what it was.
244	With very little to go on, Kinsey finds the residents of the insular community are not forthcoming. She finds Tom was held in high respect, while reactions to Selma range from tolerance for Tom's sake to downright dislike. Tom's colleagues in the sheriff's department, including Tom's partner Rafer LaMott and brother Macon Newquist, close ranks around his memory, though their respective wives, as well as Selma's 25-year-old son by her first marriage, Brant, are slightly more friendly and helpful to Millhone, as is CHP officer James Tennyson, who found Tom's body. A frustrating search of Tom's home office reveals nothing more than some doodling and a list of phone numbers; but it seems someone is worried about what Kinsey might find when she is first threatened by a masked driver, then attacked in her temporary accommodation, the dismal Nota Lake Cabins run by Tom's elder sister Cecilia Boden.
245	Retreating to Santa Teresa to lick her wounds (two dislocated fingers and a beaten-up jaw), Kinsey follows up leads from the phone numbers she found in Tom's office, from which she finds Tom was interested in the case of a petty criminal, Alfie Toth, whom he had traced to a hotel in Santa Teresa before Toth died in what might have been a murder or a bizarre suicide. Toth's unusual death has curious similarities to that of a prison associate of his, career-criminal, child-abuser, and rapist Pinkie Ritter, who died 5 years earlier but whose body only came to light near Nota Lake shortly before Toth was killed. Following up more of Tom's recent phone calls, Kinsey traces local sheriff's department officer Colleen Sellers, who had been in love with Tom, who reluctantly assists with information that Tom was suspicious that someone close to him was responsible for the deaths of both Toth and Ritter. When she also finds out that one of Ritter's daughters, Margaret, worked for Tom at the sheriff's department, Kinsey reluctantly realizes she has to return to Nota Lake to wrap up the case. Now enduring open hostility in the town and a sinister atmosphere of danger and unsure whom she can trust, Kinsey discovers that Rafer's daughter Barrett has had Tom's missing field notes since his death—but they are in code.  Belatedly, Kinsey cracks the code and realizes that the threat comes not from one of Tom's colleagues, but his step-son, Brant, who had himself been sexually abused by Ritter, killed him in retaliation, and then killed witness Toth later when he found out through Tom's investigation where Toth was. It was the realization that Brant had committed murder, and that Brant had found Toth through him, that was causing Tom's anguish before his death. Despite being unwittingly drugged by Brant in a final showdown, Kinsey manages to subdue him, much to Selma's horror.
246	The organization publishes, since 1994, the "Never Again" magazine. The magazine is focused on countering intolerance, fascism, racism and xenophobia. A 2009 cover story on "Slavic Abuse", by Marcin Kornak, described groups that committed to the pagan Rodzimowierstwo beliefs coupled with right-wing leanings. Kornak described in the article the far-right, fascist, appropriation of neo-paganism with roots in Jan Stachniuk's pre-WWII Zadruga movement. Kornak asserted that fascist neo-paganism sees the role of paganism as "an ideological fist aimed the Judeo-Christian concept of charity, humility, ..." saying this was a perversion of the original Slavic religion which certainly was not based on antisemitic complexes. Kornak's article elicited a response in Gniazdo periodical in which the writer noted that in his view Kornak's basic thesis was correct but complained that Kornak "sees "little Nazis" almost everywhere".
247	"No Flashlight": Songs of the Fulfilled Night received generally positive reviews upon release. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from music critics, the album has received an average score of 72 based on 5 critics, indicating "generally favourable reviews". In a positive review Dom Sinacola of CokeMachineGlow wrote that "No Flashlight doesn’t sound much like a lullaby worth revisiting each night. Amazingly, Mount Eerie still crafts a series of passages that breathes, and walks, and enjoys a generous restraint." Zac Pennington and Adam Gnade of Portland Mercury wrote that "After releasing three consecutive records of masterfully progressive conceptual vision, Elverum's latest (as its title suggests) seems to be more about a search for something than a destination", "And though at times frustrating, it's the questions that keep me consistently coming back to No Flashlight. So Phil: what does Mount Eerie mean, anyway?"
248	In a review by Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that "Phil is obviously trying to communicate a particular message with little abstraction. He's taking this opportunity to share with us something special to him, and he's doing so in the most honest way he can." Elizabeth Newton of The Quietus praised the album writing that "Fluctuations in Elverum's persona, self-consciously sullen and wrung from second thoughts, ultimately add up to a stable whole because his tone remains so thoroughly distinctive" and that "Now more than ever, this music is laced with its maker's insistent worldview at every turn, and it's better for it." 
249	A mixed review by Stylus wrote that "because Elvrum’s philosophy is a rather muddled one (even with a surfeit explanation bordering on the absurd), it tends to take away from the album at key moments. Musical highlights like the beautifully hummed “How?” are weighed down by Elvrum's insistence on calling the visible world “the romance” or the unfortunate lyric “Because the pupil of my eye is a hole / There’s no Inside and there’s no Out / The world is in me and I am in the world” from the shimmering “No Inside, No Out.”"
250	"O" is the third studio album from the orchestral rock group The Flowers of Hell. It consists of one song lasting 46 minutes in its stereo mix and 42 minutes in its surround sound mix. The release's liner notes state that the piece is an exploration of band leader Greg Jarvis's synesthesia and was conceived as a piece of absolute music (music with no specific subject matter). It consists of rehearsed improvisations performed with-in a 12 part fixed song structure, recorded in one take at the end of a 9000 km tour. In a 2010 interview with Spinner, Jarvis said that "O" was also designed to explore music's unique capabilities as an art form that unfolds over time.
251	Kinsey's curiosity is roused when she receives a call from a man who has bought some of her possessions at an auction of defaulted storage locker items. She recognizes the box as stuff which she left in the possession of her former husband, Michael Magruder – whom she met and married during her time on the Santa Teresa Police Force at the age of 21. She walked out after eight months in 1972.  Mickey had asked her to give him a false alibi when he was accused of violence against a recently returned Vietnam veteran Benny Quintero, who later died. Kinsey refused to lie, assuming his guilt, and left him.
252	As well as high school and police academy memories, she finds in the box a letter written to her 14 years before, shortly after she left Mickey, which never reached her. It is from Dixie Hightower, barmaid at an old haunt from that era called the Honky-Tonk, saying that Mickey was with her the night he was accused of killing Benny.  While shocked to find out her husband was cheating, Kinsey realises she did Mickey an injustice thinking he killed Benny and sets out to find out what has happened to him.  The trail leads her to Shack, a former colleague of Mickey's, and to Tim Litenberg, the son of another colleague, who is running the Honky-Tonk, as well as to Dixie herself, living in new-found luxury with her Vietnam vet husband Eric.  Kinsey finds out Mickey had been frequenting the Honky-Tonk and is suspicious of his motives, sensing that he had uncovered some sort of illegal activity. She also contacts Mark Bethel, Mickey's lawyer on the Quintero manslaughter charge, another veteran now running for political office.
253	Two LAPD officers shock Kinsey with the news that Mickey is in a coma, having been shot with a gun registered to her, a present from Mickey she abandoned along with him.  She is disconcerted to find this puts her high on the suspect list, especially since her assurances that she hasn't spoken to Mickey in years are belied by a record of a 30-minute call from Mickey's number to her apartment in recent weeks.  Illegally breaking into Mickey's apartment in search of answers, Kinsey finds a stash of weapons, false IDs, and evidence of a trip Mickey made to Louisville, Kentucky, but her search is interrupted by a biker called Carlin Duffy, looking for Mickey, and who has been a frequent visitor in recent months according to Mickey's neighbor Wary Beason.  Duffy, a habitual criminal, turns out to be Benny Quintero's half brother, and like his brother, hails originally from Louisville.  Clearly he and Mickey shared an interest in finding the truth about Benny's death. From Duffy, Kinsey learns that Mickey was interested in Benny's connections to a young Louisville journalist called Duncan Oaks, who was killed in Vietnam. Benny had Duncan's press pass and dog tags, which Duffy passed to Mickey, and which Kinsey assumes have been stolen from Mickey’ s apartment, though she later find she has them herself, sewn into a jacket of Mickey's she took from the apartment as a souvenir.
254	Kinsey follows Mickey's trail to Louisville. She discovers that Oaks was injured in Vietnam but disappeared in transit for medical treatment, and also that he was a classmate of Mark Bethel's wife Laddie. She deduces that Duncan and Laddie had some sort of affair, giving Mark Bethel a motive for Duncan's disappearance in Vietnam. Back in Santa Teresa, the LAPD detectives reappear and confirm they have traced Bethel's fingerprints in Mickey's apartment, searching for the missing press pass, and suspect him of shooting Mickey. They compare notes and conclude that Bethel must have pushed Oaks out of the medical helicopter, witnessed by Benny Quintero. When Quintero headed for California after the war and presumably tried to blackmail Bethel, Bethel killed him and set Mickey up to take the rap.  Years later when Mickey finally uncovered the truth, Bethel shot him, implicating Kinsey.
255	The "Ode-to-Napoleon" hexachord is the six-member set-class with the highest number of interval classes 3 and 4 yet lacks 2s and 6s. 6-20 maps onto itself under transposition three times (@0,4,8) and under inversion three times (@1,4,9) (six degrees of symmetry), allowing only four distinct forms, one form overlapping with another by way of an augmented triad or not at all, and two augmented triads exhaust the set as do six minor and major triads with roots along the augmented triad. Its only five-note subset is 5-21 (0,1,4,5,8), the complement of which is 7-21 (0,1,2,4,5,8,9), the only superset of 6-20. The only more redundant hexachord is 6-35. It is also Ernő Lendvai's "1:3 Model" scale and one of Milton Babbitt's six all-combinatorial hexachord "source sets".
256	In 1976, Reed Waller founded Vootie, a fanzine intended to promote funny animal comics. He began developing the concept for "Omaha" the Cat Dancer after one of the magazine's contributors said that there was not enough sex in the genre. Inspired by Robert Crumb's Fritz the Cat, Waller began looking for a theme for his new comic. He visited local strip clubs in St. Paul with his sketchbook, and read newspaper articles about attempts to shut the bars down. Another contributor to the magazine, Jim Schumeister, proposed a comic called Charlie's Bimbos, in which "a bevy of strippers champion liberty in the face of Puritan oppression". This proposal sparked the idea for Omaha.
257	The character debuted in The Adventures of Omaha, which was published in Vootie in 1978. The first chapter of "Omaha" the Cat Dancer was published by Kitchen Sink Press in Bizarre Sex No. 9 in 1981. A five-page untitled story appeared in Bizarre Sex No. 10 in 1982, as a followup to the first chapter. In 1983, a one-page parody strip starring Omaha, titled "Hotsizz Twonkies", was published in E-Man No. 5 by First Comics. Another five-page untitled story, identified as "Shelly and Omaha" in The Collected Omaha Volume 1, appeared in Dope Comix #5; it was reprinted in Bizarre Sex Series No. 5. In 1991, the Omaha story "A Strip in Time" appeared in Munden's Bar Annual No. 2, published by First Comics.
258	The Omaha series began more regular publication in 1986 through by Kitchen Sink Press, which published 21 issues through June 1994. However, in August 1988, Worley was injured in a car accident; the series' frequency slowed as a result of her recovery process. In November 1991, Waller was diagnosed with colon cancer; two issues of Images of "Omaha" were published in 1992 to pay for Waller's medical expenses, featuring art and writing by several major comic creators. In 1995, Waller and Worley ceased production of the series. In 2002, Waller and Worley agreed to complete the story; Worley was diagnosed with lung cancer, and began chemotherapy and radiation treatments in that year. On June 6, 2004, Worley died before completing the story; her husband, James Vance began to edit and complete the final chapters.
259	After working as a locally popular dancer, she and Shelly meet Chuck Katt, an artist who begins to fall in love with Omaha and whom she considers "normal". After a new blue law is passed, "all strip clubs are to be closed down", Omaha and Shelly are put out of work. Shelly soon finds a hidden sub-basement at a restaurant that is owned by a man named Charles Tabey, a powerful, yet mentally ill business tycoon, with Shelly as his lover in secret. With Omaha out of work, Chuck Katt starts working for his former boss, Andre DeRoc, a media mogul in the town and the arch-rival of Charles Tabey.
260	"Omaha" the Cat Dancer was the first of several comic books in the early 1980s which integrated sex into their storylines, rather than using sexual explicitness for shock value. In 1988, Friendly Frank's, a comic book store in suburban Chicago, was fined $750 for selling "obscene" material, including "Omaha" the Cat Dancer; as a result of the obscenity controversy, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund was formed. In 1990, issues of "Omaha" the Cat Dancer were seized by New Zealand authorities; the country's Obscene Publications Tribunal declared that the series was not indecent. In the same year, police in Toronto seized issues of the comic, claiming that it depicted bestiality.
261	Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona, the first wife of Dr. Dowan Purcell, to move along the stalled investigation by police of his disappearance. He disappeared nine weeks earlier, on September 12, 1986. The first wife is more concerned than present wife Crystal. Fiona, embittered by the breakdown of her marriage, is convinced that Dow has engineered his own disappearance, as she alleges Crystal is having an affair and admits that Dow has gone missing a couple of times before. In support of this, his passport and thirty thousand dollars seem to be missing. In contrast, Crystal, a former stripper Dow met on a trip to Las Vegas, is convinced he is dead.  Not impressed either with Fiona's haughty personality or the chances of turning up something on a cold trail, Kinsey accepts the case with misgivings.
262	She soon finds evidence that there has been fraudulent Medicare/Medicaid activity at Pacific Meadows, the care home at which Purcell worked as medical director following his retirement from general practice. Opinions vary amongst his former colleagues and associates as to whether Purcell could have been responsible, whether deliberately or through administrative incompetence; but since he is missing, he is certainly a convenient scapegoat for any blame that might be assigned by the ongoing official investigation.  Kinsey meets an old acquaintance in the form of Dana Glazer, formerly Dana Jaffe, now married to wealthy businessman Joel Glazer, co-director of the management company that owns Pacific Meadows. By coincidence, Kinsey's landlord Henry adds to the evidence of fraud when sorting through the finances of Rosie's recently deceased sister, Klotilde, who had stayed at Pacific Meadows. Kinsey struggles to work out whether Dow did a runner with some illegal gains, killed himself having realized he was going to be implicated, or was entirely innocent but murdered by the real perpetrator of the fraud.
263	In a sub-plot, Kinsey has decided it is time to leave her current rented office space at Kingman and Ives and finds her dream office space up for rental by brothers Richard and Tommy Hevener. After snapping it up with a big advance rent payment, and starting to date the attractive Tommy, Kinsey receives a shocking visit from one Mariah Talbot, who explains that the Heveners are suspects in the murder of their parents in Texas some years before. Given Kinsey's blossoming relationship with Tommy, she is hoping Kinsey will help her entrap the brothers. Kinsey is in a dilemma; ultimately, Henry carries out the entrapment himself to protect Kinsey after failing to persuade her to steer clear of it. After a dangerous showdown with the Hevener brothers, in which Richard kills Tommy with Kinsey's gun, Kinsey finds out that she was duped by Mariah Talbot; she is really the sister of the Heveners' hired accomplice, whom they are also suspected of murdering.
264	Meanwhile, Kinsey has become embroiled in Purcell's complex family; and a search for Crystal's tearaway teen daughter Leila leads to Kinsey's discovery of Dow's car in a lake near Fiona's property. When the car is pulled out, Dow's body is in it. Kinsey has technically done her duty to Fiona, but she still wants to know how and why Dow died.  She finds that Leila was behind the missing thirty thousand dollars and that Crystal is innocent of the affair Fiona had alleged. Kinsey establishes that it is Joel Glazer and his business partner who are responsible for the Pacific Meadows fraud; Dow Purcell had uncovered it. They are not the killers, however: a bullet hole at Crystal's property implicates her. In the absence of Kinsey's usual explanatory epilogue, the motive is implied; Crystal is in a relationship with Leila's school counsellor, Anica.
265	However, he has a secret agenda: to free inmates of the concentration camps. During one such daring rescue, he hides disguised as a scarecrow in a field and is inadvertently shot by a German soldier idly engaging in a bit of target practice. Wounded, he still manages to free a celebrated pianist from a work gang. Later, his students guess his secret when they see his injury and connect it to a story about the wounding of the latter-day Scarlet Pimpernel in a newspaper. They enthusiastically volunteer to assist him.
266	When applied to the concentration camps and extermination camps established by Nazi Germany in German-occupied Poland, the terms "Polish death camp" and "Polish concentration camp" have been widely characterized as misnomers. These phrases have been occasionally used by politicians and news media in reference to the camps' geographic location in German-occupied Poland. However, Polish officials and organizations have objected to such terms as misleading, as they can be misconstrued as meaning "death camps set up by Poles" or "run by Poland". Some Polish politicians have portrayed inadvertent uses of the expression by foreigners as a deliberate disinformation campaign.
267	The western part of prewar Poland was annexed outright by Germany. Some Poles were expelled from the annexed lands to make room for German settlers. Parts of eastern Poland became part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine and Reichskommissariat Ostland. The rest of German-occupied Poland, dubbed by Germany the General Government, was administered by Germany as occupied territory. The General Government received no international recognition. It is estimated that the Germans killed more than 2 million non-Jewish Polish civilians. Nazi German planners called for "the complete destruction" of all Poles, and their fate, as well as that of many other Slavs, was outlined in a genocidal Generalplan Ost (General Plan East).
268	Defenders argue that the expression "Polish death camps" refers strictly to the geographical location of the Nazi death camps and does not indicate involvement by the Polish government in France or, later, in the United Kingdom. Some international politicians and news agencies have apologized for using the term, notably Barack Obama in 2012.CTV Television Network News President Robert Hurst defended CTV's usage (see § Mass media) as it "merely denoted geographic location", but the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council ruled against it, declaring CTV's use of the term to be unethical. Others have not apologized, saying that it is a fact that Auschwitz, Treblinka, Majdanek, Chełmno, Bełżec, and Sobibór were situated in German-occupied Poland.
269	Opponents of the use of these expressions argue that they are inaccurate, as they may suggest that the camps were a responsibility of the Poles, when in fact they were designed, constructed, and operated by the Germans and were used to exterminate both non-Jewish Poles and Polish Jews, as well as Jews transported to the camps by the Germans from across Europe. Historian Geneviève Zubrzycki and the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) have called the expression a misnomer. It has also been described as "misleading" by The Washington Post editorial board, The New York Times, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, and Nazi hunter Dr. Efraim Zuroff. Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem described it as a "historical misrepresentation", and White House spokesman Tommy Vietor referred to its use a "misstatement".
270	As early as 1944, the expression "Polish death camp" appeared as the title of a Collier's magazine article, "Polish Death Camp".  This was an excerpt from the Polish resistance fighter Jan Karski's 1944 memoir, Courier from Poland: The Story of a Secret State (reprinted in 2010 as Story of a Secret State: My Report to the World). Karski himself, in both the book and the article, had used the expression "Jewish death camp", not "Polish death camp". As shown in 2019, the Collier's  editor changed the title of Karski's article typescript, "In the Belzec Death Camp", to "Polish Death Camp".
271	On 30 April 2004 a Canadian Television (CTV) Network News report referred to "the Polish camp in Treblinka". The Polish embassy in Canada lodged a complaint with CTV. Robert Hurst of CTV, however, argued that the term "Polish" was used throughout North America in a geographical sense, and declined to issue a correction. The Polish Ambassador to Ottawa then complained to the National Specialty Services Panel of the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council. The Council rejected Hurst's argument, ruling that the word "'Polish'—similarly to such adjectives as 'English', 'French' and 'German'—had connotations that clearly extended beyond geographic context. Its use with reference to Nazi extermination camps was misleading and improper."
272	On 23 December 2009, historian Timothy Garton Ash wrote in The Guardian: "Watching a German television news report on the trial of John Demjanjuk a few weeks ago, I was amazed to hear the announcer describe him as a guard in 'the Polish extermination camp Sobibor'. What times are these, when one of the main German TV channels thinks it can describe Nazi camps as 'Polish'? In my experience, the automatic equation of Poland with Catholicism, nationalism and antisemitism – and thence a slide to guilt by association with the Holocaust – is still widespread. This collective stereotyping does no justice to the historical record."
273	In 2013 Karol Tendera, who had been a prisoner at Auschwitz-Birkenau and is secretary of an association of former prisoners of German concentration camps, sued the German television network ZDF, demanding a formal apology and 50,000 zlotys, to be donated to charitable causes, for ZDF's use of the expression "Polish concentration camps". ZDF was ordered by the court to make a public apology. Some Poles felt the apology to be inadequate and protested with a truck bearing a banner that read "Death camps were Nazi German - ZDF apologize!" They planned to take their protest against the expression "Polish concentration camps" 1,600 kilometers across Europe, from Wrocław in Poland to Cambridge, England, via Belgium and Germany, with a stop in front of ZDF headquarters in Mainz.
274	In May 2012 U.S. President Barack Obama referred to a "Polish death camp" while posthumously awarding the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Jan Karski. After complaints from Poles, including Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski and Alex Storozynski, President of the Kosciuszko Foundation, an Obama administration spokesperson said the President had misspoken when "referring to Nazi death camps in German-occupied Poland." On 31 May 2012 President Obama wrote a letter to Polish President Komorowski in which he explained that he used this phrase inadvertently in reference to "a Nazi death camp in German-occupied Poland" and further stated: "I regret the error and agree that this moment is an opportunity to ensure that this and future generations know the truth."
275	The Polish government and Polish diaspora organizations have denounced the use of such expressions that include the words "Poland" or "Polish". The Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs monitors the use of such expressions and seeks corrections and apologies if they are used. In 2005, Poland's Jewish Foreign Minister Adam Daniel Rotfeld remarked upon instances of "bad will, saying that under the pretext that 'it's only a geographic reference', attempts are made to distort history and conceal the truth." He has stated that use of the adjective "Polish" in reference to concentration camps or ghettos, or to the Holocaust, can suggest that Poles perpetrated or participated in German atrocities, and emphasised that Poland was the victim of the Nazis' crimes.
276	On 6 February 2018 Poland's President Andrzej Duda signed into law an amendment to the Act on the Institute of National Remembrance, criminalizing statements that ascribe collective responsibility in Holocaust-related crimes to the Polish nation, It was generally understood that the law would criminalize use of the expressions "Polish death camp" and "Polish concentration camp". After international backlash, the law was revised to remove criminal penalties, but also the exceptions for scientific or artistic expression. The law met with widespread international criticism, as it was seen as an infringement on freedom of expression and on academic freedom, and as a barrier to open discussion on Polish collaborationism, in what has been described as "the biggest diplomatic crisis in [Poland's] recent history".
277	The "Prosopa" Greek Television Awards were annual awards about the Greek television. They were the only notable awards in the history of Greek television, since they lasted thirteen years, covering the most successful period of the Greek television. They began in 1997, organised by Tv Ethnos, a magazine issued by the Greek newspaper Ethnos. The last awards were given in 2009. The next years the awards stopped because the productions of Greek television were limited due to Greek debt crisis. The last years the awards were sponsored by telecommunications company WIND Hellas.
278	"Pussy Cats" Starring the Walkmen, often referred to as just Pussy Cats, is a cover album by The Walkmen, released in 2006. The album is a song-for-song cover of the 1974 Harry Nilsson album Pussy Cats which was produced by John Lennon.  The decision to cover the Pussy Cats album, which is a band favourite, started off as a joke that evolved into a full-fledged album released only 5 months after their previous record, A Hundred Miles Off. The album also served as a last project for the band's studio, Marcata Recording.  Marcata, which band members Matt Barrick, Paul Maroon and Walter Martin built in 1999, was located in a building owned by Columbia University, which took the property back in 2006.  The making of the album, which took "about ten days," was filmed by Norman "Rockwell" Coady and the footage was made into the documentary In Loving Recognition, included on the album's accompanying DVD.
279	Though the book is a work of fiction, it is based on an unsolved homicide that occurred in Santa Barbara County, California in August 1969. A Jane Doe victim had been dumped near a quarry in Lompoc, California, and never identified. At a dinner party, Sue Grafton had a conversation with Dr. Robert Failing, who mentioned the case. He is the forensic pathologist who worked for the Coroner's Office which had retained her maxilla and mandible. The victim was never identified, and never associated with any known missing person's case. It was hoped that the additional publicity generated by the book (along with the facial reconstruction done by internationally recognized forensic sculptor Betty Gatliff, funded by Grafton), would help turn up additional leads, but so far, unsuccessfully. As of 2011, the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Office is still hoping to find additional leads, and has the images of the facial reconstruction on their page.
280	Kinsey Millhone agrees to escort Reba, the daughter of Nord Lafferty, out of prison to the Lafferty mansion and watch over Reba until she is settled into her life out of prison. Reba was serving a sentence for embezzlement, though she had not embezzled funds; her boss had spent the funds on bribing municipal officials for the construction of a shopping mall with office space in the center of Santa Teresa. Lieutenant Cheney Phillips encounters Kinsey at the office of the probation officer for Reba Lafferty, as he is the local investigator in a multi-agency operation to arrest Reba's boss, Alan Beckwith. Several federal agencies are pursuing him for laundering funds for a Colombian drug dealer.
281	Touring the new offices in the development completed while Reba was in prison, Reba and Kinsey find the room where Beckwith bundles cash in small bills to carry out to Panama, where he owns a bank. He either flies on his own jet or sails his own ship to carry the heavy bundles without close examination by customs. Reba at first thinks the cash belongs to Beckwith and steals a packet worth $25,000. Beckwith learns of the theft when his Colombian dealer tells him the cash is short. Reba then understands from Kinsey that the cash was being laundered for the Colombian.  Reba goes to Reno to meet her friend from prison, Misty Raine. Besides her profession as a stripper, Misty makes false passports and driver licenses; she makes a set for Marty. Reba has already seen that Beckwith had a set of false papers for his trip to leave the country, as he is aware of the pressure building from the federal investigation.
282	Kinsey pursues Misty in Reno when Reba disappears from her family home. Her hunch is good, and she finds Reba with Misty. Reba agrees to drive back to California with Kinsey, aware that she has broken the terms of her parole by leaving the state. The two meet Marty in a hotel in Beverly Hills. Abruptly, a couple of goons grab Marty in the hotel lobby where they talk and beat him up. Reba tells the hotel they need help and she flees, while Kinsey pursues Marty in hopes of helping him. Kinsey hits one goon hard with a chair, but she is then knocked unconscious. She revives in the presence of Beckwith and his goons, solving the question of who sent those men to beat up the comptroller. Reba lets Beckwith know that she has the computer and the data discs that he uses to back up his business affairs, including the money laundering. Beckwith threatens Kinsey so that Reba will bring the computer and the discs to him. She does so. In the office, Marty lies dead. Beckwith claims the man had a heart attack; the beating did not kill him. Presented with the computer and the discs, Beckwith carefully pours a strong acid over them so they cannot be read. Reba reveals that she switched the computers with Marty's aid. Behind Beckwith, the team of police, led by Cheney Phillips, arrives with guns out.
283	The stadium has hosted two Major League Baseball (MLB) exhibition series, one between the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds on April 6–7, 1967 and the other between the Atlanta Braves and Baltimore Orioles on April 1, 1974. In the series between the Cleveland Indians and Cincinnati Reds, future MLB managers Dusty Baker and Davey Johnson of the Indians hit home runs and Pete Rose played in the series for the Reds. In the Braves/Orioles game, Hank Aaron hit a home run, which was three days prior to his tying Babe Ruth's lifetime homerun record at 714 home runs at the Braves' home opener.
284	The "Red Terror" Martyrs' Memorial Museum in Addis Ababa was established in 2010 as a memorial to those who died during the Red Terror under the Derg government. The museum has displays of torture instruments, skulls and bones, coffins, bloody clothes and photographs of victims. In free tours of the museum, guides describes the history leading up to the Red Terror (starting from Haile Selassie's 80th birthday celebration), the actions taken toward citizens who opposed the Derg, how the prisoners were treated and how they secretly communicated among each other.
285	"'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman" is a science fiction short story by American writer Harlan Ellison published in 1965. It is nonlinear in that the narrative begins in the middle, then moves to the beginning, then the end, without the use of flashbacks. First appearing in the science fiction magazine Galaxy in December 1965, it won the 1966 Hugo Award, the 1965 Nebula Award and the 2015 Prometheus Hall of Fame Award. The story has been translated into numerous foreign languages. "'Repent, Harlequin!' Said the Ticktockman" was written in 1965 in a single six-hour session as a submission to a Milford Writer's Workshop the following day. A version of the story, read by Ellison, was recorded and issued on vinyl, but has long been out of print. The audio recording has since been reissued with other stories, by Blackstone Audio, under the title "The Voice From the Edge, Vol. 1". It was first collected in Ellison's Paingod and Other Delusions and has also appeared in several retrospective volumes of Ellison's work, including Alone Against Tomorrow, The Fantasies of Harlan Ellison, The Essential Ellison, Troublemakers and The Top of the Volcano. 
286	The story opens with a passage from Civil Disobedience by Henry David Thoreau. The story is a satirical look at a dystopian future in which time is strictly regulated and everyone must do everything according to an extremely precise time schedule.  In this future, being late is not merely an inconvenience, but a crime.  The crime carries a hefty penalty in that a proportionate amount of time is "revoked" from one's life.  The ultimate consequence is to run out of time and be "turned off". This is done by the Master Timekeeper, or "Ticktockman", who utilizes a device called a "cardioplate" to stop a person's heart once his time has run out.
287	The story focuses on a man named Everett C. Marm who, disguised as the anarchical Harlequin, engages in whimsical rebellion against the Ticktockman. Everett is in a relationship with a girl named Pretty Alice, who is exasperated by the fact that he is never on time. The Harlequin disrupts the carefully kept schedule of his society with methods such as distracting factory workers from their tasks by showering them with thousands of multicolored jelly beans or simply using a bullhorn to publicly encourage people to ignore their schedules, forcing the Ticktockman to pull people off their normal jobs to hunt for him.
288	On 15 September 2011, Ellison filed a lawsuit in federal court in California, claiming that the plot of the 2011 film In Time was based on "Repent...". The suit, naming New Regency and director Andrew Niccol as well as a number of anonymous John Does, appears to base its claim on the similarity that both the completed film and Ellison's story concern a dystopian future in which people have a set amount of time to live which can be revoked, given certain pertaining circumstances by a recognized authority known as a Timekeeper. The suit initially demanded an injunction against the film's release, though Ellison later altered his suit to instead ask for screen credit before ultimately dropping the suit, with both sides releasing the following joint statement: "After seeing the film In Time, Harlan Ellison decided to voluntarily dismiss the Action.  No payment or screen credit was promised or given to Harlan Ellison.  The parties wish each other well, and have no further comment on the matter."
289	John Williams was born October 19, 1938, to Mary Palmer, aged sixteen from Port Allen, Louisiana. Mary was forced to give the infant away at five days old to Adelle "Della" Gatlin Williams. He was raised by Della and her husband Lucius Williams on Terpsichore Street in uptown New Orleans. According to John Williams' daughter Deborah, "Lucius was a laborer. John's mother Adelle influenced him musically because she sang and played guitar and piano. It was told to me that she once played piano for Mahalia Jackson. My father's mother was very religious and only sang gospel music, sometimes on street corners in the French Quarter. She never recorded, just travelled everywhere to spread the gospel." Deborah Williams related to author John Broven, "I think my grandmother influenced John the most because my mother, Mary Marks, said that my grandmother told my father, 'You are meant to sing', and she didn't want him to have a regular job – she didn't want him to do anything but just that. By the age of 18 he was performing. John Williams had a scar that ran from his eye to his chin that was the origin of his nickname. Huey "Piano" Smith said later that the scar proved useful one night when a promoter came up short with the group's money. Smith recalled the promoter told him, "I'm go’ pay you now, because, see, first of all my boys are scared of y’all boys, especially the one with the scar on his face!" The scar was the consequence of being hit by a car when he was a small boy.
290	Huey Smith recruited eighteen-year-old "Scarface" John Williams and Sidney Rayfield (Huey's barber) to join him and sometime vocalist Bobby Marchan in the newly formed Huey Smith and the Clowns. The band was signed to a long-term contract with Ace Records. In early 1957, Huey recorded the song with which he's most identified – "Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu". On the session, in addition to Smith on piano, were sax man Lee Allen, Earl King on guitar, Frank Fields on bass, and Charles "Hungry" Williams on drums. Not caring for the sound of his own voice, Huey instructed John Williams to move nearer to the mic. "Get in closer John," he said. "I'm trying to get a hit out of this."
291	A parade of musicians moved through the ranks of the Clowns. Williams, who was also a Mardi Gras Indian, sang lead or back-up vocals in various Clown configurations. Huey Smith had an open-minded approach to who sang lead vocals. "Some things like 'Beatnik Blues', 'Genevieve', I figure John Williams can do better than Bobby (Marchan)," Huey said. Williams was the lead singer on other songs for Huey, including "Tu-Ber-Cu-Lucas And The Sinus Blues", and "Quit My Job". He sang with Bobby Marchan on "Don't You Just Know It", Gerri Hall on "Would You Believe It (I Have A Cold)" and "Pop-Eye", as well as on "Just A Lonely Clown", "For Crying Out Loud", "Scald-Dog", and "Talk To Me Baby". Huey Smith and the Clowns, including Williams, recorded the massive two-sided hit "High Blood Pressure" and "Don't You Just Know It", which stayed thirteen weeks on the Hot 100, the latter climbing to #9. It was one of the biggest records of 1958.
292	Williams was among the many Clowns who left to pursue a solo career, including Curley Moore, Gerri Hall, Bobby Marchan, Issachar "Junior" "Izzycoo" Gordon, and Raymond Lewis among others. John Williams, James Black, and Eugene Harris left the Clowns in the early 1960s to form the Tick-Tocks. They first recorded with Bobby Marchan as Bobby Marchan and the Tick Tocks for Bobby Robinson's Fury Records in 1960. In 1962 they recorded for Robinson's Enjoy Records as the Tick-Tocks, and Rush Records as Johnny Williams and the Tic Tocs. From 1966 through 1967 John Williams & the Tick Tocks recorded for Allen Toussaint and Marshall Sehorn's Sansu Records. Deacon John Moore, who worked with Huey Smith and the Clowns also gigged with the Tick-Tocks at the Dew Drop Inn. "The Tick-Tocks did all the Clowns’ songs and some Coaster songs," Moore said. They were like a show group. They had crazy antics and a lot of good choreography, a lot of tumble sets and splits. They would come out in costumes. Some would be dressed as women." Harold Battiste who recorded the Tick Tocks for New Orleans' AFO Records remembered they were "very energetic on stage". At the time, the Tick Tocks comprised John Williams, Eugene Harris, Alvin Carter and a young Walter "Wolfman" Washington.
293	It was "Scarface" John Williams who contributed the trademark "Mardi Gras" sound to Huey Smith's records. He was a founding member, and later Big Chief, of the Apache Hunters Mardi Gras Indian tribe. Howard Miller, Chief of the Creole Wild West Indians, remembered that as a twelve-year-old he knew a little bit about the Mardi Gras Indian tradition. A few neighborhood kids were participants, including one friend. "I didn't know he masked Indian until I saw him and I stayed with him all day," he said. "A lot of times, back in the 1960s, they didn't tell you nothing about that they were masking. Everything was sealed in that sacred secret mode." Miller told his companion he wanted to mask Indian and his friend said he would take him to meet his chief. "I would go around there (by chief's house) but they never would let me in, and in fact they wouldn't let me in the yard," Miller recalled with a laugh. He finally entered the yard and then went onto the porch. "I'm looking through the screen door and I'm seeing all this magical stuff going on in there." It then started to rain and Miller heard the chief say, "Is that boy still on the porch?’ and he finally asked him in. The chief, John ‘Scarface' 'Crazy Horse’ Williams, had knocked over some beads and Miller offered to pick them up and also sweep the floor. Then the chief said the words the youngster had been longing to hear, “So you want to mask Indian." “That's the chief who gave me my first feather and made me an Indian."
294	The song "Brother John", first recorded by the Wild Tchoupitoulas, was adapted from street lore by Cyril Neville as a eulogy to "Scarface" John Williams. Chief Jolly (George Landry) of the Wild Tchoupitoulas stated that it was in 1972 that Williams "got stabbed to death outside a bar at St. Andrew and Rampart. It was right after Carnival when he died. So they made up a song about him, just made up- out in the streets." New Orleans musician Aaron Neville said, "I was close with Scarface when we were teens. He sang with Huey 'Piano' Smith and the Clowns in the early 1950s and then with the Tick Tocks—significant R&B groups in New Orleans. Scarface and I hung out a lot at the Dew Drop Inn on LaSalle Street. His death was a big blow, not only because he was a well-known musician but also because he was the Big Chief of the Mo Hawk Hunters (Apache Hunters) and a friend of our uncle, Big Chief Jolly." "In the case of 'Brother John'", Cyril Neville noted, "I wrote the lyrics in the early '70s with my Uncle Jolly. They're set to a song with an African rhythm that was popular with every Mardi Gras Indian tribe then. James "Sugar Boy" Crawford was first to popularize this rhythm on his 1954 hit 'Jock-a-Mo.' I wrote 'Brother John's' lyrics with my uncle as a tribute to a friend—John 'Scarface' Williams—who had been killed a short time earlier." Art Neville added, "My three brothers and I were all singers and musicians, but we didn't officially come together as a group until 1976, when we sang back-up harmony on 'The Wild Tchoupitoulas' --my Uncle Jolly's album. It was named after his tribe and featured Mardi Gras Indian call-and-response chants. Members of the New Orleans band the Meters were on there, and it was co-produced by Allen Toussaint. That's the first time we recorded Cyril's 'Brother John'." Mac Rebennack remembered, "'Scar' John was a special cat. He saved my life one time. We were standing outside the Robin Hood Club listening to Little Miss Cornshucks when he suddenly said, 'Look out, man.' So I looked out and half a St. Louis brick came sailing past my head. All the Nevilles singing about him was special on that record."
295	Cyril Neville's lyrics refer to "Brother John" as "a mighty brave, with a heart of steel" who "never would bow and he never would kneel." The reference to Cora in the song refers to "Corrine Died On The Battlefield" a song by Danny Barker, based on a story Barker had heard of a woman killed in a much earlier Indian altercation. According to Paul Longpre, former Chief of the Golden Blades, Cora Anne was a Queen who masked with the Battlefield Hunters. "She got killed in ’27 or ’28 at the Magnolia bridge… She got caught in a crossfire between the Hunters and the Wild Squatoolas."  "There have been many songs about John", said Cyril Neville, "I hope mine expressed that weird mixture of violence and beauty that was part of our R&B street life".
296	On March 4, 1972, just eighteen days after Mardi Gras, "Scarface" John Williams, the 33-year-old chief of the Apache Hunters, was stabbed in the heart as he tried to stop a fight at a Dryades St. bar in New Orleans. The incident happened a few blocks from Sidney Rayfield's barbershop. Rayfield ran to the scene and lifted his fellow Clown from the gutter. Williams, the New Orleans Times-Picayune reported on March 5, 1972, "wounded in the chest and neck, was pronounced dead on the scene. A seven-inch butcher knife was used." John's wife, Mary, remembered seeing his body lying by a street drainage portal. "The blood was running down the drain," she said. "The blood stayed in that spot for years. Even the rain didn't wash it away."
297	The funeral procession for Williams was described in the Times-Picayune as "not unlike a traditional jazz funeral", and included the Apache Hunters, Wild Magnolias, Golden Stars, White Eagles,and Yellow Pocahontas tribes accompanying his body from Fourth and Daneel streets to Melpomene and S. Claiborne Avenues. The musical accompaniment was by Mardi Gras Indians chanting and the rhythm of tambourines. The Times-Picayune reported "an improvised jazz band joined in" at the conclusion with a rendition of "Just A Closer Walk With Thee". The procession also stopped to chant and dance at the bar where the chief was slain. "We gonna do our thing outside where he got killed," Golden Star Indian Warren Williams told a Times-Picayune reporter. "Scarface" John Williams was buried in Providence Memorial Cemetery.
298	A German Salafist posted on YouTube a propaganda video showing a poster with the English headline "Shariah Controlled Zone", followed by images of Salafists recruiting young people and visiting gambling houses. Joerg Rademacher, spokesman for the interior ministry, said the video was "a new provocation and part of the Salafist propaganda, which shows that the scene does not acknowledge Germany's rule of law". Officials of Northrhein-Westphalia say there are about 1,800 Salafists in the state, of whom 10 percent are considered to be violent extremists. Justice Minister, Heiko Maas, told Bild that "the state alone" was responsible for the administration of justice in Germany, and any illegal parallel system of law enforcement would not be tolerated.
299	A few years later, 13 year-old Tom went to other radio stations and watched the disc jockeys on the air. Tom visited Radio KDEO where he met program director "Sunny Jim" Price, who wanted to get a teenager's opinion of a song he was considering adding to the playlist. Price played the song for Tom, who liked it. The song was "California Dreamin'" by The Mamas & The Papas. Radio KDEO was the first station in the country to play it. Price gave Tom his first job at a radio station helping with remote broadcasts.
300	At 21, Tom worked at KACY in Port Hueneme, California using the name Bobby McAllister. There, he met DJ Dave Conley who named him Bobby "Shotgun" McAllister. Less than a year later, Tom and Dave moved to radio station KAFY in Bakersfield, California. Tom wanted to use his real name, but the general manager did not like the name Irwin, and asked Tom to change his last name on the air to Kelly. Dave Conley suggested the name "Shotgun," from Bobby "Shotgun" McAllister, and they ended up using the name "Shotgun Tom" Kelly. In addition to radio, Tom took a weekend job at television station KERO, and did a television kid's show as NEMO the Clown.
301	The "Showtime" Band performs at all home football contests. In addition to performances at Howard, "Showtime" has a travel schedule that has included performances at numerous NFL games including: the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Jets, Buffalo Bills, Washington Redskins, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Baltimore Ravens, to name a few. These performances have received both national and international attention. Invitations were extended to participate in the 1990 Shrewsbury Music Festival in London, England, the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade in New York, Bermuda Day festivities in Bermuda, and the Inaugural Parade for President Barack Obama.
302	John William Payne was born in Helena, the son of Gladys Swope Payne and William G. Payne.  In 1940 he began working as a paper boy, and met and became friends with blues musicians Robert Lockwood, Jr. and Sonny Boy Williamson.  He applied for work at radio station KFFA when it began operating in 1941, and started as a janitor and errand boy at the station two days before broadcasts began.  In 1942, in the absence of the station's owner and announcer Sam Anderson, he also began reading commercials on the station's 15-minute slot sponsored by the King Biscuit Flour company, and began learning to play bass. Later that year, he lied about his age and joined the U.S. Army, going on to serve in the 75th Signal Battalion in the Aleutian Islands and New Guinea.
303	He left the armed forces in 1948 in San Antonio, Texas, and joined with guitarist friend Bud Davis to accompany Tex Ritter on tour.  He worked as a bass player with Ritter, Harry James and others, touring and working in Chicago until 1951, when he returned to Helena and secured a job as an announcer at KFFA.  That year, he began working as host of the King Biscuit Time show.  By the time he began regular broadcasting, the show had already won a wide audience as a hugely influential medium for blues in the Delta at a time when little African-American music was heard on the air. Initially, blues musicians such as Sonny Boy Williamson mainly played live in the studio, and later the program switched primarily to playing records.  The show's reputation grew over the years to international proportions, enhanced by Sonny Payne's off-the-cuff patter. He gained the nickname "Sunshine" after a grumpy on-air comment about the weather, when taking part one day in a live outside broadcast, was taken up as a running joke by Robert Lockwood Jr.  It is currently broadcast from the KFFA studio located in the Delta Cultural Center in Helena. Payne died on February 10, 2018, at the age of 92, having suffered a stroke sometime recently.
304	The album is best known for the song "Dazed and Confused" because Led Zeppelin released their interpretation of the song on their 1969 debut album Led Zeppelin.  Page was familiar with Holmes' song because his previous band, The Yardbirds, had covered the song. The Led Zeppelin song was not credited to Jake Holmes.  While Holmes took no action at the time, he did later contact Jimmy Page in regards to the matter but received no reply. In June 2010, Holmes filed a lawsuit against the guitarist for copyright infringement in a United States District Court, claiming Page knowingly copied his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, with future Led Zeppelin releases crediting "Dazed and Confused" to "By Page – Inspired by Jake Holmes.", and the case was permanently closed.
305	virtually all the information Thompson draws on comes from whites; as she ruefully notes, 'only occasionally can the voice of one of the slaves be heard.' Nonetheless, her command of the sources makes possible an almost encyclopedic description of theconditions of slave life. What did slaves eat? At Mount Vernon, cornmeal, buttermilk, fish and, at harvest time, meat, supplemented by food grown in their own gardens or stolen from the big house. What clothing did Washington provide? Aside from the livery for domesticslaves, male slaves each year received a wool jacket and two pairs of trousers, two coarse linen shirts and a pair of shoes; females got a jacket, a skirt, a pair of stockings and two linen shifts.... On the much debated question of whether African elements survived in slave culture, Thompson acknowledges that the evidence is scanty but cautiously suggests that some naming practices, religious beliefs and methods of food preparation reflect an African inheritance....
306	"The Spaghetti Incident?" is the fifth studio album by the American hard rock band Guns N' Roses. The album is composed of covers of older punk rock, hard rock, and other songs.  "The Spaghetti Incident?" is the only studio album to feature rhythm guitarist Gilby Clarke, who replaced original Guns N' Roses member Izzy Stradlin during the band's Use Your Illusion tour in 1991, as well as the last album to feature guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Matt Sorum, following the departure of them in 1996 and 1997, respectively (until the return of Slash and McKagan in 2016). It is also the only Guns N' Roses album not to be promoted with a tour, as well as their final album to date featuring their longtime producer Mike Clink.
307	In 1992, the band prepared to release the leftover cover tracks as an EP, with Clarke replacing Stradlin's guitar tracks. They later decided on making the album a full release and recorded several more tracks for it. Bassist Duff McKagan sings on many of the album's tracks and Hanoi Rocks frontman Michael Monroe appears on "Ain't It Fun" as a guest vocalist. This was the last Guns N' Roses album to feature lead guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan, drummer Matt Sorum, and the only album to feature Clarke. It was also the band's last studio album for 15 years until Chinese Democracy, and its last album until the live compilation album six years later with Live Era: '87-'93.
308	Rose claimed "the reason we didn't list that song on our album is we wanted to downplay it. We don't give any credit to Charles Manson on the album; it's like a hidden bonus track." The band considered removing the song from new pressings of the album, with David Geffen stating in a phone interview, "I would hope that if Axl Rose had realized how offensive people would find this, he would not have ever recorded this song in the first place. The fact that Charles Manson would be earning money based on the fame he derived committing one of the most horrific crimes of the 20th century is unthinkable to me." Slash mentioned that the song was "done with naive and innocent black humor on our part". Rose stated he would donate all performance royalties from the song to a nonprofit environmental organization. Slash stated that the group intended to remove the song before deciding to keep it once they learned that royalties from the song would be donated to Bartek Frykowski, the son of Wojciech Frykowski, a victim of Manson during the Tate Murders. Geffen Records released a statement mentioning their share of royalties would be donated to the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau. Years later, Rose said the song would be removed from new pressings of the album, claiming that critics and the media had misinterpreted his interest in Manson. Rose can be seen wearing a Manson shirt in the video for "Estranged" and during a concert in Milton Keynes, England, in 1993. Rose explained wearing the shirt as "trying to make a statement" because "a lot of people enjoy playing me as the bad guy and the crazy. Sorry, I'm not that guy. I'm nothing like him." Despite the statement that the track would be removed, "Look at Your Game, Girl" is still featured on pressings of the album.
309	Although Guns N' Roses never toured in support of "The Spaghetti Incident?", some of the songs were performed live prior to its release. The first track, "Since I Don't Have You", was performed a few times as an intro to songs "Sweet Child o' Mine" or "Paradise City" in 1992 and 1993. "Down on the Farm" was performed once in its full length during the 1990 performance in the Farm Aid IV show. It was also played a few times during the Chinese Democracy Tour in 2006. The band performed "Hair of the Dog" once in 1988, and again in 1990, during the only known "The Gak" (band featuring members of Guns N' Roses, Metallica and Skid Row) performance. "Attitude" was performed frequently during the Use Your Illusion Tour, and Duff still plays it in Loaded and his solo career. Other songs played live by Duff McKagan are "New Rose", "You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory" and "Raw Power". The other songs were never played live by Guns N' Roses, but might have been played by some of the members' side projects, like Matt Sorum's supergroup Camp Freddy, that plays cover versions of famous songs, as well as Neurotic Outsiders, the supergroup Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum were part of. Guns N' Roses played "Attitude" and - for the first time - "Raw Power" live in Buenos Aires (Argentina) in April 2014 with Duff McKagan on vocals. "Attitude", "Raw Power" and "New Rose" were played during the Not in This Lifetime... Tour.
310	Her partner, she says, was a feminist, a hopeless businessman, a journalist who could not hold down a staff job, and a passionate fighter and investigator for social causes and against the Far Right. The memoir details how the couple met and their struggles together at Expo, the anti-fascist publication Larsson founded in 1995. Larsson's crusade against Sweden's right wing fascist movements put him in constant danger and Gabrielsson writes that neo-Nazis left death threats on the couple's answering machine and sent bullets in the mail, and suggests that part of the reason the two of them never married was that it would have made Larsson an easier target for his opponents on the right.
311	In her book, Gabrielsson also describes her struggle with Erland and Joakim Larsson, Stieg's estranged father and brother, over control of Larsson's work. Gabrielsson explains feeling "dispossessed" after Larsson's death because, as a common law partner in Sweden with no children, she had no inheritance rights. At one point, Erland and Joakim offered Gabrielsson roughly $3.3 million, but she does not want money and will continue to fight for the literary rights of Larsson's work. One source interviewed a friend who said that Gabrielsson "will not be bought." According to Gabrielsson, Larsson had written 200 pages of a fourth novel in his internationally successful Millennium series before he died; she has been seeking the legal authority to be in charge of what will happen to these 200 pages as well as with all of Larsson's literary work and success, though so far Larsson's family has refused to give her these rights. If granted the literary rights of Stieg Larsson's Millennium series, however, Gabrielsson explains that she is not sure that it is fair for a ghostwriter to complete the work that Larsson had started.
312	In April 1988, Kinsey Millhone is hired by a young man named Michael Sutton to investigate a memory that he claims to have recovered of two people burying a body in the woods in the exclusive Horton Ravine neighborhood in 1967, when he turned six years old.  He claims that the burial took place on his birthday, two days after a famous unsolved kidnapping of a four-year-old named Mary Claire in the neighborhood, in which the kidnappers requested $25,000 but never picked up the ransom after police were called.  She was never found.  Although Michael's memory is hazy, he and Kinsey manage to locate the spot of the burial, but a police dig uncovers only the body of a wolfdog named Ulf. One of the bystanders watching the dig, a banker named Walker McNally, who was a high school classmate of Kinsey, spends the entire weekend drinking and kills a young woman in a DUI on Sunday night.
313	Kinsey learns that Sutton was involved in a past "recovered memory" event that proved false, while greatly disrupting his family.  Bothered by this, Kinsey traces the dogtag back to the dog's owner, who told her that the dog had been euthanized around that time.  No one has any idea how the remains ended up in Horton Ravine.  Upon returning to Horton Ravine to talk to the neighbors, Kinsey learns that Rain, the four-year-old granddaughter/adopted daughter of the couple that formerly owned the lot, had been kidnapped in a similar fashion just before Mary Claire but was returned unharmed after her parents paid a ransom of $15,000 using marked bills, which also never turned up.
314	A parallel story set in the 1960s is initially told from the viewpoint of Deborah Unruh, Rain's grandmother.  Greg, the Unruhs' son, returned home with his pregnant girlfriend Shelly after dropping out of college in 1963.  Five days after she gave birth to their daughter Rain, they left, leaving the baby behind.  Two years later, the Unruhs formally adopted Rain.  Two years after that, in 1967, Greg and Shelly (now calling themselves Creed and Destiny) returned to borrow $40,000 against Greg's trust, but the Unruhs refused to make such a loan.  Greg and Shelly left unexpectedly not long thereafter.  Almost immediately after they left, Rain was kidnapped.
315	In another set of flashbacks, the story of the successful writer Jon Corso, Walker's best friend in high school, is told.  Walker and Jon became friends with Greg and Shelly during their second visit, and Jon started an intense sexual affair with Shelly.  Shelly told Jon her plan to kidnap Rain for ransom, but Jon decided to implement the plan on his own so that he and Walker could afford their own apartment when they started college in the fall.  Walker, in fact, was the person who tipped off the draft board about Greg.  Jon and Walker buried the ransom money after realizing it was marked; but they moved the money and substituted the dog after being seen, to make their digging look harmless. Still needing money after burying Rain's ransom, they kidnapped Mary Claire; but she died from an allergic reaction to Valium, which they used to keep her sedated during her kidnapping.
316	Back in the present, Michael Sutton sees Walker at an AA meeting (which Walker has attended since his DUI) and follows him, remembering him as one of the two diggers.  Michael calls Kinsey to tell her, since no one else believes him any longer.  Panicked by his role in two deaths (the "undertow" of the title), Walker calls Jon and says he is going to turn himself in for the kidnapping, despite the lack of evidence.  Jon talks him into a small delay and then shoots and kills Michael.  Since Walker has an airtight alibi for the time of the killing, Kinsey immediately suspects Jon due to their close friendship in high school.  She heads to Jon's house, where she sees him leaving with suitcases, and follows him to a secluded meeting with Walker.  Jon's plan to murder Walker and flee the country is foiled by Kinsey, who shoots him after he pulls a gun on her; and both Jon and Walker are arrested.  Mary Claire's body and the marked money are both recovered on Jon's family's property.
317	In a side story, Kinsey is invited to a family event. During the preparation for the event, which Kinsey resists attending, she is given letters from her grandmother that her Aunt Gin, who raised her, had refused. She learns that, far from ignoring her, her grandmother had wanted to adopt her after her parents' deaths and had even hired a private investigator to gain custody of her. In a final irony, she learns that Gin and the private investigator had had an affair and that little Kinsey had gone on outings with them. In the end, she attends the family event, where her grandmother, who is increasingly senile, mistakes her for her late mother and tells her how happy she would be if Kinsey were to come visit her.
318	Sarah Weinman of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Grafton "has produced a better book each time out, and "U" is her most structurally complex, psychologically potent book to date. Marilyn Stasio of The New York Times wrote, "So has this reliable series lost its addictive appeal? Not at all — though it’s a shock to realize that the stories, set in a California coastal town in the 1980s, now read more like historical narratives than contemporary novels with a slight time lag. But it’s an object lesson in disciplined storytelling to watch Grafton manipulate that time frame to broaden the story and deepen the mystery."
319	The novel follows Eugene Buckingham, the only son of a South Carolina planter, as he crosses paths with Julia Tennyson, a Scottish American journalist who has written a number of pamphlets under various pseudonyms. What begins as mutual friendship eventually evolves into love, despite the anxieties of the opposing fathers. Col. Buckingham – Eugene's father and a (fictional) descendant of the Duke of Buckingham – contests the partnership on the grounds that Julia has written pamphlets degrading all planters as vicious sadists, even though he is not. Likewise Dr. Tennyson – Julia's father and a Scotsman – objects because he supports the view of all planters as violent and cruel.
320	AllMusic reviewer Lindsay Planer stated "The nine sides on Unk in Funk (1974) are among the last newly recorded material that Muddy Waters would issue during his nearly 30 year association with Chess Records. Backing up the Chicago blues icon is a band he'd carry with him for the remainder of his performing career ... They run through a better than average selection of Waters' classics with newer compositions more or less tossed in, presumably to keep the track list fresh. Although Waters certainly has nothing to prove, he attacks his old catalog with the drive and command of a man putting it all on the line".
321	"Unplugged" Live is a live album by the McAuley Schenker Group, recorded in California, during a tour with a completely acoustic set. Michael Schenker released this live album at the height of "unplugged" mania in the early 1990s, revising his blistering guitar antics as reflective, nylon-string, semi-classical ballads. The album features Shark Island guitarist Spencer Sercombe on second guitar and backing vocals. "Unplugged" Live is the final release of the McAuley Schenker Group, which disbanded in 1993; Robin McAuley got married and retired from the music scene for a few years, while Michael Schenker began working on instrumental solo projects.
322	On October 30, 2007, a second single, and first actual radio single from the album, "Queen B." was posted into a flash audio player on the official website, along with selected tracks by Keenan projects. On October 1, 2007, the video was posted on the Puscifer YouTube channel. The video features several fully CGI Maynards as pawns in a chess game between two women. The album debuted at number 25 on the Billboard 200, selling about 27,000 copies in its first week. On October 7, 2007, "Trekka (Sean Beaven Mix)" was published on Puscifer.com. And on October 25, 2007, the entire album was put up for listening.
323	For the fourth straight novel in the Alphabet Mystery series, the viewpoint alternates between Millhone and other characters, principally Nora Vogelsang and Lorenzo Dante. The opening chapter, however, is told from the perspective of a well-to-do young man, Phillip Lanahan, who borrows money from Dante, misses the payback date, and then loses it playing poker in Las Vegas. Dante and his brother Cappi show up, and Dante agrees to take Phillip's Porsche as satisfaction of the debt. However, after Dante sends Phillip and Cappi up to look at the car, Cappi has thugs throw Phillip off the top of the parking garage to his death.
324	In the main storyline, Millhone witnesses a woman shoplifting with a confederate inside the department store Nordstrom's. She tells a nearby clerk, who alerts store security, and they capture and arrest the woman, named Audrey, before she can escape. While this is going on, Millhone follows her confederate and is almost run over by her in the parking garage. Right after her release from jail, Audrey apparently commits suicide. Shortly thereafter, Millhone runs into a former boyfriend in the police department, Cheney Phillips, who is out for the evening with a vice officer, Len Priddy, and his much-younger girlfriend, Abbey. Len Priddy was a friend of Millhone's first husband and is a longtime enemy of hers. Priddy mocks the theory that Audrey was part of a shoplifting ring, but Audrey's boyfriend hires Millhone to investigate that theory.
325	Meanwhile, Dante realizes that the police are closing in on his operation. Audrey had been head of his shoplifting operation, but Cappi murders her upon her release from jail because he believed she was about to turn them in. Dante believes that Cappi has been giving information to Priddy to set up his brother, so that he can take over.  Nora, who has been drifting apart from her husband for the last three years (which we later learn began with the death of her son Phillip from her first marriage), learns that her lawyer husband is having an affair with his secretary. She decides to sell some jewelry to provide her with enough money to be able to leave her husband. She is referred to Dante, who is instantly drawn to her and offers her more than fair value for the ring. Against her better judgement she agrees to meet Dante, who becomes fascinated by Nora and all that she represents.
326	Kinsey, still investigating the death of Audrey, has a sudden flash of inspiration from an offhanded comment by her client; she returns to the department store to view the video footage and notices a bumper sticker on the car which had almost run her down. This leads her to the accomplice. She discovers after trailing her for several days that she is the drop off person who deposits stolen goods into a fake charity's drop off box. The bags are then picked up minutes later by a truck that takes them to Dante's warehouse for distribution to various second hand stores around Southern California.
327	When Kinsey gives Cheney a copy of her findings thus far, he tells her to back off as she could be endangering the life of a confidential informant. This causes her to do the exact opposite. She investigates further and slowly peels back the layers of the syndicate. Her old friend Pinky Ford (the man who gave her her first set of lock picks) comes to her office and asks her to hold on to some photos for him. Kinsey refuses. Later Lt. Priddy comes to the office looking for the photos and threatens Kinsey physically. She manages to track down Pinky and find out that the photos are blackmail material that Priddy has been using to get information from Pinky about Dante's operation.
328	Pinky leaves Kinsey's care and returns home. Kinsey tracks Pinky to his home, to find Cappi holding Pinky's wife hostage. Cappi orders Kinsey to burn the photos and the negatives in the fireplace. Cappi leaves without harming anyone further, but an enraged Pinky gets his shotgun from the closet and follows him out to the street and shoots at him, but misses Cappi completely. Cappi fires off a couple of rounds that seem to miss everyone, and he flees the scene. When Kinsey and Pinky go back into the house, they see that his wife has been shot. She is taken to the hospital, where Pinky worries about how they can afford her treatment.
329	Kinsey tracks down Dante at his office, where she tells him what has happened. Dante takes the time to set up an account at the hospital to take care of Pinky's wife, even though he is in the middle of preparing to leave the country. After feeding bad information to his brother Cappi, whom he suspected of leaking information to Priddy, Dante had tried to convince Nora to join him. He confessed that it was because of him that her son had been murdered, but that it was done without his knowledge or consent. He explained his motivation for lending Phillip the money and gave her the details of his trip. He leaves hoping that she will join him.
330	On the day that Dante had told Cappi the computer records would be wiped out, Pinky's wife dies from her gunshot wound. Kinsey goes to Dante's warehouse to try to keep Pinky from killing Cappi, and sees federal authorities preparing to raid the warehouse. Looking for Pinky at the warehouse, she encounters Dante again. When the raid begins, Pinky is wounded in the leg by Cappi, who is eventually shot by police. Dante punches Kinsey in the face, knocking her out and preventing her from getting between Cappi and Pinky and possibly being shot herself. He then disappears into the maze of tunnels under the warehouse. He is picked up by his real secretary and makes it to the airport, where he has chartered a flight out of the country. Just as his plane is taxiing away from the gate, Nora arrives and leaves with him.
331	Weeks later Dante's secretary comes to Kinsey's office to give her an envelope full of cash to make up for Dante punching her in the face, and also as payment for a job he wants her to do for him. Dante had recorded a conversation with Priddy that would implicate him in trying to gain control of Dante's operations, and which would put him in prison. Wary of contacting the proper authorities who might bury the information and never go after Priddy, Kinsey calls a 'gung ho' reporter who she knows will publish the story, after which the authorities will have no choice but to arrest and prosecute Priddy.
332	On 22 December 1945, in War Department Circular 383, the United States Army decided to introduce the "V" device to distinguish the award of a Bronze Star Medal for acts of valor and heroism, rather than meritorious service. Soldiers, including Army airmen, who were awarded the Bronze Star Medal for heroism in combat were now authorized to wear a bronze "V" on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. Only one "V" was allowed to be worn on a ribbon. The Department of the Navy introduced the "V" as the "Combat Distinguishing Device", and on 15 February 1946, authorized the "V" device to be worn on the Legion of Merit and Bronze Star Medal for services or acts performed in actual combat with the enemy; in February 1947, this was changed to acts or services involving direct participation in combat operations.Most World War II veterans who were entitled to the "V" probably did not know about or apply for the device, since large-scale separations from the services were taking place after the war ended. Stocks of the device also were not available for issue for at least a year after the issuance of the Army circular.
333	To be worn on a decoration, the "V" device must have been specifically authorized in the written award citation issued with the medal.  In 1996, the "V" device garnered public attention after the suicide of Admiral Jeremy Boorda, who was the Chief of Naval Operations. The news media reported that his death by suicide may have been caused by a Navy investigation following a story by Newsweek about Boorda wearing two "combat valor pins" on the service ribbons of his uniform, which he received for duty as a weapons officer and executive officer aboard two naval ships off the coast of Indochina during the Vietnam War. Although there were indications these "combat distinguishing devices" were authorized to be worn on his Navy Commendation Medal and Navy Achievement Medal, the Department of the Navy Board For Correction of Naval Records determined after his death that both of the devices were not authorized to be worn on the two decorations.
334	In 2011, the Department of Defense changed its awards manual regulations concerning the Medal of Honor, specifying that the "V" device instead of the oak leaf cluster and 5⁄16 inch star would be used to denote additional citations in the rare event of a service member being awarded a second MoH. By May 2015, the Department of Defense changed its awards manual again concerning the Medal of Honor, specifying that a separate MOH is presented to an individual for each succeeding act that justifies an award. There has not been a living repeat Medal of Honor recipient since the World War I era, so the "V" device has never actually been worn in this fashion.
335	Until 2017, the criteria and conditions under which the "V" device could be awarded differed among the services. For the Army, the "V" was worn solely to denote "participation in acts of heroism involving conflict with an armed enemy". For the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the "V" could be worn to denote combat heroism, or to recognize individuals who were "exposed to personal hazard during direct participation in combat operations". For the Air Force, the "V" could be worn on the Bronze Star Medal to denote heroism in combat, but also on the Commendation Medal and Achievement Medal to denote heroism or for being "placed in harm's way" during contingency deployment operations.
336	Prior to 1 January 2014, the device was also authorized on Outstanding Unit Awards and Organizational Excellence Awards to indicate the unit participated in direct combat support actions. The "V" device is also authorized for the Air Medal by all the services where heroism in aerial combat was involved on an individual mission. On 15 August 2016, the Coast Guard changed their criteria such that new awards of the "V" would be for valor only, to denote a heroic act or acts while participating in conflict or combat with an armed enemy. On 6 January 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was revising its military decorations and awards program to include a "V" device change to its original 1940s use of denoting heroism in combat only on specific decorations for the military services. Two new "C" and "R" devices will also be used on relevant awards.
337	For the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the "V" is always worn in the center of the service ribbon, while any gold or silver 5⁄16 Inch Stars are added in balance to the right and left of the "V" starting with the right side from the wearer's perspective. Marine Corps refer to it as Combat Distinguishing Device.   The Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard continue to award and issue the bronze version. The Marine Corps allows anodized medals and anodized Combat "V"s to be worn on the dress blues uniform. 
338	Just 57 days after then 25-year old former US Air Mail pilot Charles Lindbergh had completed his historic Orteig Prize-winning first-ever non-stop solo transatlantic flight from New York (Roosevelt Field) to Paris (Le Bourget) on May 20–21, 1927 in the single-engine Ryan monoplane Spirit of St. Louis, "WE", the first of what would eventually be 15 books Lindbergh would either author or significantly contribute to, was released on July 27, 1927. The 318-page illustrated volume was published by G.P. Putnam's Sons (The Knickerbocker Press), the New York publishing house run by prominent promoter and aviation enthusiast George P. Putnam (1887-1950) who later promoted the career (and eventually married) another almost equally famous flyer of the era, the ill-fated American aviatrix Amelia Earhart. The suddenly world-famous young aviator noted on the book's dust jacket cover that he wrote it himself to provide the public with his "own story of his life and his transatlantic flight together with his views on the future of aviation".As such Lindbergh's virtually "instant" autobiography proved to be an immediate best seller and remained so for over a year.
339	Both the dust jacket notes of the first edition as well as the frontispiece illustration reveal that the book's simple, one-word "flying pronoun" title "WE" was meant to refer to a "spiritual" partnership between Lindbergh and his airplane developed "through the dark hours of his flight". However Putnam's had selected the title without its author's knowledge or approval, and Lindbergh would later often complain about that interpretation of its meaning as being incorrect. Instead he said that "we" referred to himself and his financial backers in St. Louis, not his airplane, as the press had people believing, although his frequent unconscious use of the phrase referring to himself and the Spirit seemed to suggest otherwise.
340	While Lindbergh had been busy being continuously feted in Washington, New York, St. Louis and elsewhere over the first couple of weeks after his return to the United States on June 10, a first manuscript for the book was quickly ghostwritten by New York Times reporter J. Carlisle MacDonald who had interviewed Lindbergh extensively in both Paris and during the six-day crossing of the Atlantic from Cherbourg to Washington on board the US Navy cruiser USS Memphis and had been holed up with a staff of secretaries in publisher George Putnam's house in Rye, New York. MacDonald had earlier ghostwritten from Paris a pair of "first person" accounts of the flight that had appeared under Lindbergh's name on the front page of the paper on May 23 and 24, two and three days after the flight.
341	The fastest book produced up to that time, a complete set of galley proofs of MacDonald's manuscript was ready for Lindbergh's approval within two weeks of his return to America. However, as with MacDonald's two original ghostwritten Times stories which the meticulous Army trained aviator had disapproved of as not only being rife with factual errors, but having been "cheaply done" and written in a "false, fawning" tone, Lindbergh rejected the ghostwritten book manuscript as well for similar reasons, i.e., MacDonald had written the book in the first person and had reverted to the bombast Lindbergh thought they had abandoned back in Paris. Lindbergh knew, however, that he could not renege on his contract with Putnam's that had already begun to publicize the book promising copies by July 1. When Fitzhugh Green, the book's editor at Putnam's, told him that "it is your book, we wouldn't want to publish it if it weren't", Lindbergh undertook to completely rewrite it himself "painstakingly in longhand" using MacDonald's manuscript as a template. Lindbergh accomplished that daunting task in less than three weeks working in solitude while a guest of businessman, philanthropist, and aviation promoter Harry Frank Guggenheim at Falaise, his sprawling waterfront mansion at Sands Point, Long Island.
342	"The noted young aviator has excited real admiration in the way he refuses to hurry publication of his story," the Times noted in reporting the unexpected delay in the publication of the book. "Had he been willing to dash off a careless job, he might have taken advantage of his wonderful notoriety and made a lot of money quickly. Instead, he insists that the book shall be the most accurate and perfect account of his life, his transatlantic flight and his experience after he reached Paris, that he can possibly put together. When his publisher urged him to hurry, his response was a new mass of hand-written manuscript so clear and so precise that the publishers felt reproved for their importunity." Lindbergh worked most of every day "writing in blue ink with a fountain pen on plain eight-by-ten-inch white bond in his largest, most readable script", counting his output by running the total at the top of each page to assure meeting his contract to produce at least 40,000 words. In less than three weeks Lindbergh delivered the last of his pages to Fitzhugh Green at just under the agreed length.
343	"WE" was officially published little more than a week later on July 27 and within six weeks it had sold over 190,000 copies at $2.50 apiece while a special limited edition of 1,000 numbered autographed copies also sold out quickly at $25 each. Soon translated into most major world languages, "WE" remained at the top of best-seller lists well into 1928. With dozens of printings and more than 650,000 copies sold in the first year, "WE" earned Lindbergh more than $250,000 in royalties. The book's great commercial success was considerably aided by its publication coinciding with the start of his three-month tour of the United States in the Spirit on behalf of the Daniel Guggenheim Fund for the Promotion of Aeronautics. The nation became obsessed with Lindbergh during the tour in which he was seen in person by more than 30 million Americans, a quarter of the nation's then population. No other author before or since ever had such an extensive, highly publicized tour that helped promote a book than did Lindbergh's "We" of himself and the Spirit during their 22,350-mile, July 20 to October 23, 1927 tour of the U.S., visiting 82 cities in all 48 states during which the nation's nascent aviation superhero delivered 147 speeches and rode 1,290 mi (2,080 km) in parades.
344	US Ambassador to France Myron T. Herrick, Lindbergh's host in Paris, contributed an impassioned foreword to "WE". "Flying was his trade, his means of livelihood," Herrick wrote. "But the love of it burned in him with fine passion, and now that his fame will give him a wider scope of usefulness, he has announced that he will devote himself wholeheartedly to the advancement of aeronautics. His first step in that direction is the publishing of this book and no one can doubt that its influence will be of enormous value in pushing on man's conquest of the air. It will be idle for me or any one else to estimate now what these results will be. But America vibrates with glowing pride at the thought that out from our country has come this fresh spirit of the air and that the whole world hails Lindbergh not only as a brave aviator but as an example of American idealism, character and conduct." In addition to Herrick's foreword, also included as an appendix is an 85-page essay by editor Green entitled A Little of what the World thought of Lindbergh describing the post-flight welcomes in Paris, Brussels, London, Washington, New York and St. Louis. While the precipitating event for the publication of "WE" was the solo non-stop flight from New York to Paris, Lindbergh's account of this takes up only 18 pages (pp. 213–230) in the book which is mostly about his life before May 20, 1927. It would not be until Lindbergh wrote his Pulitzer Prize winning The Spirit of St. Louis a quarter-of-a-century later in 1953 that he provided a first hand book length account of the flight itself.
345	Reviews for the book were generally positive although expressed disappointment that so little of the text provided an account of the preparation for and the flight to Paris itself. "Now that Lindbergh has spoken, we inquisitors are apt to be disappointed, at least upon superficial reading of his story," noted Horace Green in his review of "WE" in the New York Times in which he nonetheless applauded Lindbergh's meticulous attention to detail. "Where is the 'inside' story that 50,000 advance buyers of the volume have been led to expect? There is none. And on second thought it is apparent that if the recital was to be in any degree a real Lindbergh product there could be no inside story. The young flying Colonel, as his friends know, has no Imagination in the personal sense, but great Imagination in the mechanical sense. His mind works without embroidery. He thinks and speaks in condensed terms suitable to his purpose. One is grateful to say that the delay in publication of the long heralded "WE" whether brought about by Lindbergh's refusal to be stampeded or by the counsel of other heads, has permitted Lindbergh to tell his own story without the interpolations, as they are known in the editorial world, of too many ghosts."
346	"Always there was some new experience, always something interesting going on to make the time spent at Brooks and Kelly one of the banner years in a pilot's life." Lindbergh noted. "The training is difficult and rigid, but there is none better. A cadet must be willing to forget all other interest in life when he enters the Texas flying schools and he must enter with the intention of devoting every effort and all of the energy during the next 12 months towards a single goal. But when he receives the wings at Kelly a year later, he has the satisfaction of knowing that he has graduated from one of the world's finest flying schools." ("WE", p. 125)
347	Since having a comedy song aired in 1976, Yankovic has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2007), recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and performed more than 1,000 live shows. His work has earned him five Grammy Awards and a further 11 nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the U.S. His first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single ("White & Nerdy") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, Mandatory Fun (2014), became his first No. 1 album during its debut week.
348	Yankovic's success comes in part from his effective use of music videos to further parody pop culture, the song's original artist, and the original music videos themselves, scene-for-scene in some cases. He directed later videos himself and went on to direct for other artists, including Ben Folds, Hanson, The Black Crowes, and The Presidents of the United States of America. With the decline of music television and the onset of social media, he used YouTube and other video sites to publish his videos; this strategy helped to boost sales of his later albums. He has stated that he may forgo traditional albums in favor of timely releases of singles from the 2010s onwards.
349	Alfred Matthew Yankovic was born in Downey, California, on October 23, 1959, the only child of Mary Elizabeth (née Vivalda) and Nick Yankovic. He was raised in Lynwood, California. His father, who was born in the Strawberry Hill neighborhood of Kansas City, Kansas, was of Yugoslav descent (the original surname spelling being Janković) and began living in California after earning two Purple Hearts for his service as a medic during World War II. He believed "the key to success" was "doing for a living whatever makes you happy" and often reminded his son of this philosophy. Yankovic's mother, who was a stenographer of English and Italian descent, married his father in 1949. She had come to California from Kentucky and gave birth to Yankovic 10 years later.
350	Yankovic's first accordion lesson, which sparked his interest in music, took place on the day before his seventh birthday. A door-to-door salesman traveling through Lynwood offered his parents a choice of accordion or guitar lessons at a local music school. Yankovic claims that his parents chose the accordion over the guitar because "they figured there should be at least one more accordion-playing Yankovic in the world", referring to Frankie Yankovic, to whom he is not related. Additionally, he said that they chose the accordion because "they were convinced it would revolutionize rock". As his mother was over-protective of him, he did not spend much time outside the house, giving him plenty of time to practice the instrument at home. He continued lessons at the school for three years before deciding to learn on his own. In the 1970s, Yankovic was a big fan of Elton John and claims John's Goodbye Yellow Brick Road album was partly how he "learned to play rock 'n roll on the accordion". As for his influences in comedy and parody music, he listed artists including Tom Lehrer, Stan Freberg, Spike Jones, Allan Sherman, Shel Silverstein, and Frank Zappa, as well as "all the other wonderfully sick and twisted artists" he found through The Dr. Demento Radio Show. Other sources of inspiration for his comedy came from Mad magazine, Monty Python, and the Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker movies. He had also enjoyed George Carlin's FM & AM comedy album so much that he had transcribed it by typewriter himself.
351	Yankovic began kindergarten a year earlier than most children and skipped second grade, later saying, "My classmates seemed to think I was some kind of rocket scientist so I was labeled a nerd early on." He attended Lynwood High School, where his unusual schooling experience meant he was two years younger than most of his classmates. He was not interested in sports or social events at school but was active in its extracurricular programs, including the National Forensic League-sanctioned public speaking events, a play based upon Rebel Without a Cause, the yearbook (for which he wrote most of the captions), and the Volcano Worshippers club; the latter, according to Yankovic, did "absolutely nothing" and was started "just to get an extra picture of [themselves] in the yearbook". He graduated in 1975, and was valedictorian of his senior class. He attended California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where he earned a bachelor's degree in architecture.
352	Yankovic received his first exposure via syndicated comedy radio personality Dr. Demento's Southern California-based radio show, saying "If there hadn't been a Dr. Demento, I'd probably have a real job now." Despite his mother having caught Yankovic listening to Dr. Demento's program and banning him from listening it again in the future, he found ways to listen to it discreetly. In 1976, Dr. Demento spoke at Yankovic's school where the then-16-year-old Yankovic gave him a homemade tape of original and parody songs performed on the accordion in Yankovic's bedroom into a "cheesy little tape recorder". The tape's first song, "Belvedere Cruisin'" – about his family's Plymouth Belvedere – was played on Demento's comedy radio show, launching Yankovic's career. Demento said, "'Belvedere Cruising' might not have been the very best song I ever heard, but it had some clever lines [...] I put the tape on the air immediately." Yankovic also played at local coffeehouses, accompanied by fellow dorm resident Joel Miller on bongos. Yankovic said:
353	During Yankovic's sophomore year as an architecture student at Cal Poly, he became a disc jockey at KCPR, the university's radio station. Yankovic had been called "Weird Al" originally as a more derogatory nickname from others within the dormitory he shared, as he was seen as the strange outcast compared to other residents. Though he initially took it as an insult, Yankovic eventually "took it on professionally" as his persona for the station. In 1978, he released his first recording (as Alfred Yankovic), "Take Me Down", on the LP, Slo Grown, as a benefit for the Economic Opportunity Commission of San Luis Obispo County. The song mocked famous nearby landmarks such as Bubblegum Alley and the fountain toilets at the Madonna Inn.
354	In mid-1979, shortly before his senior year, "My Sharona" by The Knack was on the charts and Yankovic took his accordion into the restroom across the hall from the radio station to take advantage of the echo chamber acoustics and recorded a parody titled "My Bologna". He sent it to Dr. Demento, who played it to good response from listeners. Yankovic met The Knack after a show at his college and introduced himself as the author of "My Bologna". The Knack's lead singer, Doug Fieger, said he liked the song and suggested that Capitol Records vice president Rupert Perry release it as a single. "My Bologna" was released as a single with "School Cafeteria" as its B-side, and the label gave Yankovic a six-month recording contract. Yankovic, who was "only getting average grades" in his architecture degree, began to realize that he might make a career of comedic music.
355	On September 14, 1980, Yankovic was a guest on the Dr. Demento Show, where he was to record a new parody live. The song was called "Another One Rides the Bus", a parody of Queen's hit, "Another One Bites the Dust". While practicing the song outside the sound booth, he met Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz, who told him he was a drummer and agreed to bang on Yankovic's accordion case to help Yankovic keep a steady beat during the song. They rehearsed the song just a few times before the show began. "Another One Rides the Bus" became so popular that Yankovic's first television appearance was a performance of the song on The Tomorrow Show with Tom Snyder on April 21, 1981. On the show, Yankovic played his accordion, and again, Schwartz banged on the accordion case and provided comical sound effects. Yankovic's record label, TK Records, went bankrupt about two weeks after the single was released, so Yankovic received no royalties from its initial release.
356	1981 brought Yankovic on tour for the first time as part of Dr. Demento's stage show. His stage act in a Phoenix, Arizona, nightclub caught the eye of manager Jay Levey, who was "blown away". Levey asked Yankovic if he had considered creating a full band and doing his music as a career. Yankovic admitted that he had, so Levey held auditions. Steve Jay became Yankovic's bass player, and Jay's friend Jim West played guitar. Schwartz continued on drums. Yankovic's first show with his new band was on March 31, 1982. Several days later, Yankovic and his band were the opening act for Missing Persons.
357	Yankovic recorded "I Love Rocky Road", (a parody of "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" originally recorded by The Arrows) which was produced by Rick Derringer, in 1982. The song was a hit on Top 40 radio, leading to Yankovic's signing with Scotti Brothers Records. In 1983, Yankovic's first self-titled album was released on Scotti Bros. The song "Ricky" was released as a single and the music video received exposure on the still-young MTV. "Ricky" broke the top 100 videos on MTV at the time, which Yankovic took as a sign that his career was in music, quitting his job as a mailroom clerk at the local offices of Westwood One to pursue the music career.
358	Yankovic released his second album "Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D in 1984. The first single "Eat It", a parody of the Michael Jackson song "Beat It", became popular, thanks in part to the music video, a shot-for-shot parody of Jackson's "Beat It" music video, and what Yankovic sarcastically described as his "uncanny resemblance" to Jackson. "Eat It" was also aided by the first of Yankovic's Al TV specials that aired on MTV on April 1, 1984, the network looking to Yankovic's rising popularity to help fill its programming time. Peaking at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 on April 14, 1984, "Eat It" remained Yankovic's highest-charting single until "White & Nerdy" placed at No. 9 in October 2006.
359	In 1985, Yankovic co-wrote and starred in a mockumentary of his own life titled The Compleat Al (the title being a parody of the 1982 documentary The Compleat Beatles), which intertwined the facts of his life up to that point with fiction. The movie also featured some clips from Yankovic's trip to Japan and some clips from the Al TV specials. The Compleat Al was co-directed by Jay Levey, who would direct UHF four years later. Also released around the same time as The Compleat Al was The Authorized Al, a biographical book based on the film. The book, resembling a scrapbook, included real and fictional humorous photographs and documents.
360	Yankovic's success led to a deal to for his film UHF, which premiered in July 1989. While the film had since become a cult title, its initial release was against mediocre reviews, and it was up against several other summer blockbusters, including Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Ghostbusters II, Batman, and Licence to Kill. While Yankovic released an associated soundtrack album, UHF – Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and Other Stuff, it was not as successful as his previous albums. Yankovic fell into a slump over the next three years as a result of the poor performance of the film.
361	Yankovic had returned to the studio to prepare songs for his next album Off the Deep End around 1990. During production, Rubén Valtierra joined the band on keyboards in 1991, allowing Yankovic to concentrate more on singing and increasing his use of the stage space during concerts. Further, Yankovic took over production from Rick Derringer in 1992. While Derringer had produced six of Yankovic's previous albums, for which he won two Grammy Awards, Derringer's drug-related issues had become an issue, along with Yankovic's more complex musical scores (involving horns and other instruments).
362	By 1992, most of the original songs for Off the Deep End were complete, but Yankovic still did not have a strong parody and was waiting for the next big hit to work from, as he was still in a slump post-UHF. When Jackson released his next album, Dangerous, and its hit single Black or White, Yankovic had quickly written a parody, "Snack All Night", from it, and hoped Jackson would allow him to use the parody. Jackson denied Yankovic this, as Jackson felt Black or White carried a serious message that would be undermined by the parody. Again, Yankovic fell into a mood and delayed release of Off the Deep End without a lead parody. Around this time, Nirvana and the grunge music scene began to take off. Yankovic wrote a parody of Nirvana's hit Smells like Teen Spirit, as Smells Like Nirvana and was able to secure the band's permission for the parody; Nirvana's lead singer Kurt Cobain was said that getting Yankovic to parody their work was a sign their band had "made it". "Smells Like Nirvana" became the lead song on Off the Deep End, landing at #35 on the Billboard charts, his second top 40 hit in the United States. Off the Deep End reached #17 on the Billboard 200, and helped to revitalize Yankovic's career after the failure of UHF.
363	Yankovic's next two studio albums were modest successes in light of Off the Deep End. Alapalooza was released in 1993, and led with "Jurassic Park", a spoof of "MacArthur Park" by Richard Harris while mocking the 1993 film of the same name. Alapalooza peaked at #46 on the Billboard 200. Bad Hair Day in 1996 headlined with "Amish Paradise", a parody of Coolio's "Gangsta Paradise". "Amish Paradise" reached #53 on the top Billboard 100 singles, while the album reached #14 on the Billboard 200, and eventually was certified Double Platinum in sales by RIAA, making it one of Yankovic's more successful works.
364	On January 24, 1998, Yankovic had LASIK eye surgery to correct his extreme myopia. When Running with Scissors debuted in 1999, he unveiled a radically changed look. In addition to shedding his glasses, he had shaved off his moustache and grown out his hair. He had previously shaved his moustache in 1983 for the video of "Ricky" to resemble Desi Arnaz, in 1989 for segments of the "UHF" music video, and in 1996 for the "Amish Paradise" video. Yankovic reasoned, "If Madonna's allowed to reinvent herself every 15 minutes, I figure I should be good for a change at least once every 20 years." He parodied the reaction to this "new look" in a commercial for his nonexistent MTV Unplugged special. The commercial featured Yankovic in the short-haired wig from the music video for Hanson's "River", claiming his new look was an attempt to "get back to the core of what I'm all about", that being "the music".
365	Running with Scissors was followed by his next studio album Poodle Hat in 2003. Poodle Hat was met with average reviews without any standout singles, though the album did peak at number 17 on the Billboard 200. Yankovic's following album was Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006, which featured the single "White & Nerdy", a parody of "Ridin'" by Chamillionaire. "White & Nerdy" became Yankovic's first Billboard Hot 100 single, debuting at #29 and peaking at #9. "Canadian Idiot", a parody of "American Idiot" by Green Day, also charted in the Hot 100. The album as a whole reached #10 in the Billboard 200, and by 2008 was Yankovic's first certified platinum album, having reached over one million sales.
366	Following Straight Out of Lynwood, Yankovic started to explore digital distribution of his songs. On October 7, 2008, Yankovic released to the iTunes Store "Whatever You Like", a parody of the T.I. song of the same title, which Yankovic said he had come up with two weeks before. Yankovic said that the benefit of digital distribution is that "I don't have to wait around while my songs get old and dated—I can get them out on the Internet almost immediately." In 2009, Yankovic released four more songs: "Craigslist" on June 16, "Skipper Dan" on July 14, "CNR" on August 4, and "Ringtone" on August 25. These five digitally released songs were packaged as a digital EP titled Internet Leaks, with "Whatever You Like" retroactively included in the set.
367	Yankovic had reported an interest in parodying Lady Gaga's material, and on April 20 announced that he had written and recorded a parody of "Born This Way" titled "Perform This Way", to be the lead single for his new album. However, upon first submitting it to Lady Gaga's manager for approval (which Yankovic does as a courtesy), he was not given permission to release it commercially. As he had previously done under similar circumstances (with his parody of James Blunt's "You're Beautiful", which was titled "You're Pitiful"), Yankovic then released the song for free on the internet. Soon afterwards, Gaga's manager admitted that he had denied the parody of his own accord without forwarding the song to his client, and upon seeing it online, Lady Gaga granted permission for the parody. Yankovic has stated that all of his proceeds from the parody and its music video will be donated to the Human Rights Campaign, to support the human rights themes of the original song. Yankovic was also a judge for the 10th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.
368	Yankovic stated in September 2013 that he was working on a new album, but gave no details. In 2014, he used social media websites to hint at a July 15 release of this new album, as noted by Rolling Stone. The album artwork and title, Mandatory Fun, were affirmed by his publisher. Yankovic said in an interview promoting the album that, with the end of his recording contract, it is likely his last traditional album, in the sense of recording and releasing that many songs at a time; he said he will likely switch to releasing singles and EPs over the Internet, a method which offers more immediate release opportunities as Yankovic considers his parodies in particular as something that can become dated by the time of release. Mandatory Fun was released to strong critical praise and was the No. 1 debut album on the Billboard charts the week of its release, buoyed by Yankovic's approach for releasing eight music videos over eight continuous days that drew viral attention to the album as described below. It became Yankovic's first No. 1 album in his career. Additionally, the song "Word Crimes" (a parody of Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines") reached No. 39 on the Top 100 singles for the same week; this is Yankovic's fourth Top 40 single (following "Eat It", "Smells Like Nirvana", and "White & Nerdy"), and made him the third musical artist, after Michael Jackson and Madonna, to have a Top 40 single in each decade since the 1980s. Since Mandatory Fun, Yankovic has not released any additional albums. In a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone, Yankovic said, "I can't tell you when any material is coming out. Inspiration could strike tomorrow and I might have something out next month. There's no plan. It's just going to be whenever it winds up being."
369	In March 2018, Al released a new song, "The Hamilton Polka", a polka medley consisting of several songs from the musical Hamilton. The song holds the distinction of being the first polka song to chart on Billboard's Digital Songs Sales Chart. After Hamilton had premiered on Disney+ in July 2020, Yankovic released a video version of "The Hamilton Polka" that synched his song to video clips from the show. Also in March, Al released two remixes of songs by Portugal. The Man: "Feel It Still" and "Live in the Moment". In 2020, he collaborated with the band again on their single "Who's Gonna Stop Me", which was released for Indigenous Peoples' Day.
370	Yankovic became a vegetarian in 1992 when his then-girlfriend gave him a copy of the 1987 John Robbins book Diet for a New America, which he said "made a very compelling argument for a strict vegetarian diet". When asked how he can rationalize performing shows at events such as the Great American Rib Cook-Off as a vegetarian, he replied, "The same way I can rationalize playing at a college even though I'm not a student anymore." In a 2011 interview with OnMilwaukee, he clarified his stance on his diet: "I am still a vegetarian, and I try to be a vegan, but I occasionally cheat. If there's a cheese pizza on the band bus, I might sneak a piece."
371	Yankovic married Suzanne Krajewski, a marketing executive with 20th Century Fox, after they met in 2001 by being introduced by their mutual friend Bill Mumy. Their daughter, Nina, was born in 2003. In stark contrast to his stage persona, Yankovic is known by friends and associates to be polite, shy, and introverted, even among family. When asked if he would call himself a Christian, he answered "Yes". A couple from his church appears with him on the cover of his album Poodle Hat. His religious upbringing is reflected in his abstinence from using profanity, alcohol, and drugs. He and his family currently live in Los Angeles, where they own a home whose previous owners include writer Jack S. Margolis and rapper Heavy D.
372	On April 9, 2004, Yankovic's parents were found dead at their home in Fallbrook, California, the victims of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning from their fireplace. Hours after his wife notified him of this, he made the decision to go on with his concert in Appleton, Wisconsin. He later said, "Since my music had helped many of my fans through tough times, maybe it would work for me as well ... it would at least give me a break from sobbing all the time." Their deaths occurred following the release of Poodle Hat, which was Yankovic's lowest-selling album in 20 years. He considered the Appleton show and subsequent tour dates therapeutic: "If I didn't have anything to distract me, I probably would have spiraled into an even deeper depression. For a couple of hours each night, I could go onstage and put on a big fake smile and pretend like everything was just okay." In a 2014 interview, he cited the deaths of his parents as the worst thing that had ever happened to him, adding, "I knew intellectually, that at some point, probably, I'd have to, you know, live through the death of my parents, but I never thought it would be at the same time, and so abruptly."
373	Yankovic is well known for creating parodies of contemporary radio hits, typically which make up about half of his studio releases. Unlike other parody artists such as Allan Sherman, Yankovic and his band strive to keep the backing music in his parodies the same as the original, transcribing the original song by ear and re-recording the song for the parody. In some cases, in requesting the original band to allow for his parody, the band will offer to help out with the recreation: Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler and Guy Fletcher perform on "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*", Yankovic's parody of Dire Straits' "Money for Nothing", while Imagine Dragons provided Yankovic with advice on how to recreate some of the electronic sounds they used for "Radioactive" in Yankovic's parody "Inactive". Yankovic's career in novelty and comedy music has outlasted many of his "mainstream" parody targets, such as Toni Basil, MC Hammer, and Men Without Hats. Yankovic's continued success (including the top 10 single "White & Nerdy" and album Straight Outta Lynwood in 2006) has enabled him to escape the one-hit wonder stigma often associated with novelty music.
374	Yankovic considers his body of work to primarily feature parodies, rather than satires of the original song or artist, as he found that satire of songs or artists has already been done before. Most Yankovic songs consist of the original song's music, with a separate, unrelated set of amusing lyrics. Yankovic's humor normally lies more in creating unexpected incongruity between an artist's image and the topic of the song, contrasting the style of the song with its content (such as the songs "Amish Paradise", "White & Nerdy", and "You're Pitiful"), or in pointing out trends or works which have become pop culture clichés (such as "eBay" and "Don't Download This Song"). Yankovic's parodies are often satirical of popular culture, including television (see The TV Album), movies ("The Saga Begins"), and food (see The Food Album). Yankovic claims he has no intention of writing "serious" music. In his reasoning, "There's enough people that do unfunny music. I'll leave the serious stuff to Paris Hilton and Kevin Federline."
375	Yankovic is the sole writer for all his songs and, for "legal and personal reasons", does not accept parody submissions or ideas from fans. There exists, however, one exception to this rule: Madonna was reportedly talking with a friend and happened to wonder aloud when Yankovic was going to turn her "Like a Virgin" into "Like a Surgeon". Madonna's friend was a mutual friend of Yankovic's manager, Jay Levey, and eventually Yankovic himself heard the story from Levey. In writing his parodies as well as his original songs, Yankovic spends a great deal of time in deciding the right words that not only match the beat of the original song but that fit theme of the parody. He says that some songs have taken him weeks to compose the lyrics to as he permeates the various choices, sometimes entering a "zombie phase" as he mulls these over in his home. For example, Yankovic believes he could have written a completely different version of "White & Nerdy" based on the alternative choices of lyrics he had come up with and had discarded for the final song. He has also done significant research for other song parodies to get facts and keywords for certain areas of knowledge, such as for "I Think I'm a Clone Now" or hospitals for "Like a Surgeon". Yankovic has documented all these past lyrical attempts, first through binders and then computerized in case he needs to go back for future songs.
376	Most of Yankovic's studio albums include a polka medley of about a dozen contemporary songs at the time of the album, with the choruses or memorable lines of various songs juxtaposed for humorous effect. In Yankovic's early career, before recording his first album, he had performed such polka medleys in live shows in California, though then using songs from lesser-known bands like Bad Brains and the Plasmatics. He had been inspired to do so from Spike Jones, who had transitioned classical music into polka. Yankovic said that converting these songs to polka was "...the way God intended". Yankovic did not include a medley on his first album, but considered this for his second, In 3-D, recognizing that it would only work if he used well-known songs. The resulting "Polkas on 45", which featured songs from Devo, Deep Purple, Berlin, and The Beatles, was popular, and the polka medley became a staple of all but one of Yankovic's future albums. Yankovic said that "fans would be rioting in the streets, I think, if I didn't do a polka medley." More current polka medleys features songs that Yankovic had wanted to parody but proved difficult, such as Daft Punk's "Get Lucky", which lacked sufficient lyrics to parody. The polkas are recorded in studio, including the sound effects which are performed live during recording, which Yankovic considered one of his favorite parts of recording.
377	Yankovic has recorded numerous original humorous songs, such as "You Don't Love Me Anymore" and "One More Minute". Many of these songs are style pastiches of specific bands with allusions to specific songs. For example, "First World Problems" from Mandatory Fun is a style take on the Pixies, with the opening stanza reminiscent of the Pixies' "Debaser". Other style parodies includes those of Rage Against the Machine with "I'll Sue Ya" (which features many aspects of the hit song "Killing in the Name"), Devo with "Dare to Be Stupid", Talking Heads with "Dog Eat Dog", Frank Zappa with "Genius in France", Nine Inch Nails with "Germs", and Queen with "Ringtone". Some songs are pastiches of an overall genre of music, rather than a specific band (for example, country music with "Good Enough For Now", charity records with "Don't Download This Song") and college fight songs with "Sports Song". Yankovic stated that he does not have any unreleased original songs, instead coming up and committing to the song ideas he arrives at for his albums and other releases.
378	One of Yankovic's recurring jokes involves the number 27. It is mentioned in the lyrics of several songs, and seen on the covers for Running with Scissors, Poodle Hat and Straight Outta Lynwood. He had originally just pulled the number 27 as a random figure to use in filling out lyrics, but as his fans started to notice the reuse of the number after the first few times, he began to purposely drop references to 27 within his lyrics, videos, and album covers. He explains that "It's just a number I started using that people started attaching a lot of importance to." Other recurring jokes revolve around the names Bob (the Al TV interviews often mention the name, David Bowe's character in UHF is named Bob, and a song called "Bob", done in the style of Bob Dylan, is featured on Poodle Hat), Frank (e.g. "Frank's 2000" TV"), and the surname "Finkelstein" (e.g. the music video for "I Lost on Jeopardy", or Fran Drescher's character, Pamela Finkelstein, in UHF). A number of songs use the phrase "internal organs". Also, a hamster called Harvey the Wonder Hamster is a recurring character in The Weird Al Show and the Al TV specials, as well as the subject of an original song on Alapalooza. Other recurring jokes include Yankovic borrowing, or being owed, $5. In a number of Al TV interviews, he often asks if he can borrow $5, being turned down every time. This motif also occurs in "Why Does This Always Happen to Me?", in which his deceased friend owes him $5. Another recurring joke is his attraction to female nostrils or nostrils in general. This also appears in numerous Al TV interviews as well as in several of his songs ("Albuquerque" and "Wanna B Ur Lovr" to name a few.) Yankovic also asks his celebrity guests if they could "shave his back for a nickel". This also appears in the song "Albuquerque". Yankovic has also put two backmasking messages into his songs. The first, in "Nature Trail to Hell", said "Satan Eats Cheez Whiz"; the second, in "I Remember Larry", said "Wow, you must have an awful lot of free time on your hands."
379	While Yankovic's musical parodies generally do not include references to the songs or the artists of the original songs, Yankovic's music videos will sometimes parody the original song's music video in whole or in part. Most notably, the video for "Smells Like Nirvana" uses an extremely similar set to Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", including using several of the same actors. This video contended with "Smells like Teen Spirit" at the 1992 MTV Video Music Awards for Best Male Video. Other videos that draw directly from those of the original song include "Eat It", "Fat", "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*", "Bedrock Anthem", "Headline News", "It's All About the Pentiums", "Amish Paradise", "Like a Surgeon", and "White & Nerdy". The video for "Dare to Be Stupid" is, as stated by Yankovic, a style parody in general of Devo videos.
380	Several videos have included appearances by notable celebrities in addition to Yankovic and his band. Dr. Demento appeared in several of Yankovic's earlier videos, such as "I Love Rocky Road" and "Ricky". Actor Dick Van Patten is featured in both "Smells Like Nirvana" and "Bedrock Anthem"; Drew Carey, Emo Philips and Phil LaMarr appeared in "It's All About the Pentiums"; Keegan-Michael Key, Jordan Peele, Donny Osmond, Judy Tenuta and Seth Green appeared in "White & Nerdy"; and Ruth Buzzi and Pat Boone appeared in "Gump". The video for "I Lost on Jeopardy" includes an appearance by Greg Kihn, the artist whose song, "Jeopardy", was being parodied, along with Don Pardo and Art Fleming, Jeopardy's original announcer and host, as themselves. Florence Henderson plays an Amish seductress in "Amish Paradise".
381	While most videos that Yankovic creates are aired on music channels such as MTV and VH1, Yankovic worked with animation artists to create music videos for release with extended content albums. The DualDisc version of Straight Outta Lynwood features six videos set to songs from the release, including videos created by Bill Plympton and John Kricfalusi; one video, "Weasel Stomping Day" was created by the producers of the show Robot Chicken, and aired as a segment of that program. For the 2010 Alpocalypse, Yankovic produced videos for every song; four of those were previously released for each of the songs on the EP Internet Leaks, with the videos for the remaining songs released via social media sites and included in the deluxe edition of Alpocalypse. These live-action and animated videos were produced by both previous collaborators such as Plympton for "TMZ", video content providers like Jib-Jab and SuperNews!, and other directors and animators.
382	To help promote his 2014 album Mandatory Fun in social media circles, Yankovic produced eight music videos for the album releasing them over eight consecutive days with release of the album, believing it "would make an impact because people would be talking about the album all week long". RCA Records opted not to fund production of any of these videos, and Yankovic turned to various social media portals including Funny or Die and CollegeHumor which he had worked with in the past; these sites helped to cover the production cost of the videos with Yankovic foregoing any ad video revenue. He chose to distribute the videos to different portals to avoid burdening any single one with all of the costs and work needed to produce them. This approach proved to be successful, as the total collection of videos had acquired more than 20 million views in the first week. This release strategy was considered by The Atlantic as a "web-enabled precision video delivery operation, and evidence of some serious digital distributional forethought" as it allows the videos to be seen by different sets of audiences for each site. The approach was considered to be essential to promoting Mandatory Fun to reach the No. 1 position on the Billboard charts on its debut week. Businessweek attributed the sales success of Mandatory Fun to the viral music video campaign. ABC World News elaborated that Yankovic's success is in part due to the Internet's interest in viral and humorous videos catching up with what Yankovic has been doing for his entire career. Yankovic himself was amazed with the response he got from the album and video releases, stating that "I've been doing the same thing for 30 years and all of a sudden I'm having the best week of my life" and that he "kind of stumbled on my formula for the future".
383	Under the "fair use" provision of U.S. copyright law, affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in the 1994 case Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc., artists such as Yankovic do not need permission to record a parody. However, as a personal rule and as a means of maintaining good relationships, Yankovic has always sought permission from the original artist before commercially releasing a parody. Yankovic stated of these efforts: "I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings. I don't want to be embroiled in any nastiness. That's not how I live my life. I like everybody to be in on the joke and be happy for my success. I take pains not to burn bridges." The communications are typically handled by his manager Jay Levey, but at times Yankovic has asked the artist directly, such as flying to Denver, Colorado, to attend an Iggy Azalea concert and speak to her personally about parodying her song "Fancy". He claims that only about two to three percent of the artists he approaches for permission deny his requests.
384	Michael Jackson was a big fan of Yankovic, and Yankovic claimed Jackson "had always been very supportive" of his work. Jackson twice allowed him to parody his songs ("Beat It" and "Bad" became "Eat It" and "Fat", respectively). When Jackson granted Yankovic permission to do "Fat", Jackson allowed him to use the same set built for his own "Badder" video from the Moonwalker film. Yankovic said that Jackson's support helped to gain approval from other artists he wanted to parody. Though Jackson allowed "Eat It" and "Fat", he requested that Yankovic not record a parody of "Black or White", titled "Snack All Night", because he felt the message was too important. This refusal, coming shortly after the commercial failure of Yankovic's movie UHF in theaters, had initially set Yankovic back; he later recognized this as a critical time as, while searching for new parodies, he came across Nirvana, leading to a revitalization of his career with "Smells Like Nirvana". Yankovic has performed a concert-only parody "Snack All Night" in some of his live shows. Yankovic was one of several celebrities who appeared in the 1989 music video for Jackson's song "Liberian Girl".
385	Dave Grohl of Nirvana said that the band felt they had "made it" after Yankovic recorded "Smells Like Nirvana", a parody of the grunge band's smash hit, "Smells Like Teen Spirit". On his Behind the Music special, Yankovic stated that when he called Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain to ask if he could parody the song, Cobain gave him permission, then paused and asked, "Um... it's not gonna be about food, is it?" Yankovic responded with, "No, it'll be about how no one can understand your lyrics." According to members of Nirvana interviewed for Behind the Music, when they saw the video of the song, they laughed hysterically. Additionally, Cobain described Yankovic as "a musical genius".
386	Mark Knopfler approved Yankovic's parody of the Dire Straits song "Money for Nothing" for use in the film UHF on the provision that Knopfler himself be allowed to play lead guitar on the parody which was later titled "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*". Yankovic commented on the legal complications of the parody in the DVD audio commentary for UHF, explaining "We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing "slash" Beverly Hillbillies "asterisk"' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. Those wacky lawyers! What ya gonna do?" The Permanent Record: Al in the Box booklet referred to the song's "compound fracture of a title". When a fan asked about the song's title, Yankovic shared his feelings on the title, replying "That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. I'm not sure why, and I've obviously never been very happy about it."
387	Chamillionaire was also very pleased, even putting Yankovic's parody "White & Nerdy" (a parody of "Ridin'") on his official MySpace page before it was on Yankovic's own page. Chamillionaire stated in an interview, "He's actually rapping pretty good on it, it's crazy [...] I didn't know he could rap like that. It's really an honor when he does that. [...] Weird Al is not gonna do a parody of your song if you're not doing it big." In September 2007, Chamillionaire credited "White & Nerdy" for his recent Grammy win, stating "That parody was the reason I won the Grammy, because it made the record so big it was undeniable. It was so big overseas that people were telling me they had heard my version of Weird Al's song."
388	In 2011, Yankovic was initially denied permission to parody Lady Gaga's "Born This Way" for his song "Perform This Way" for release on a new album, but through his release of the song on YouTube and subsequent spread via Twitter, Lady Gaga and her staff asserted that her manager had made the decision without her input, and Gaga herself gave Yankovic permission to proceed with the parody's release. Gaga considered herself "a huge Weird Al fan", and she stated that the parody was a "rite of passage" for her musical career and considered the song "very empowering".
389	Yankovic states that his style parodies have also been met with positive remarks by the original artist. He noted that his friends and fellow musicians Ben Folds and Taylor Hanson helped to support their respective style parodies "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?" and "If That Isn't Love". He also noted positive reactions he got through friends his band members have, such as from Frank Black of The Pixies for "First World Problems" and Southern Culture on the Skids for "Lame Claim to Fame", and a similar praise when he encountered Graham Nash of Crosby, Stills, and Nash on the street, and was able to play his recently completed "Mission Statement" for him.
390	One of Yankovic's most controversial parodies was 1996's "Amish Paradise", based on "Gangsta's Paradise" by hip-hop artist Coolio, which, in turn, was based on "Pastime Paradise" by Stevie Wonder. Reportedly, Coolio's label gave Yankovic the impression that Coolio had granted permission to record the parody, but Coolio maintains that he never did. While Coolio claimed he was upset, legal action never materialized, and Coolio accepted royalty payments for the song. After this controversy, Yankovic has always made sure to speak directly with the artist of every song he parodied. At the XM Satellite Radio booth at the 2006 Consumer Electronics Show Yankovic and Coolio made peace. On his website, Yankovic wrote of this event, "I don't remember what we said to each other exactly, but it was all very friendly. I doubt I'll be invited to Coolio's next birthday party, but at least I can stop wearing that bulletproof vest to the mall." In an interview in 2014, Coolio extended his apology for refusing his permission, stating that at the time "I was being cocky and shit and being stupid and I was wrong and I should've embraced that shit and went with it", and that he considered Yankovic's parody "actually funny as shit".
391	On numerous occasions, Prince refused Yankovic permission to record parodies of his songs. Yankovic had stated in interviews prior to Prince's death in 2016 that he had "approached him every few years [to] see if he's lightened up". Yankovic related one story where, before the American Music Awards where he and Prince were assigned to sit in the same row, he got a telegram from Prince's management company, demanding he not make eye contact with the artist. Among parodies that Yankovic had ideas for included one based on "Let's Go Crazy" about The Beverly Hillbillies, "Yellow Snow" as a parody of "Purple Rain", "1999" as an infomercial with a call-in number ending in −1999, and parodies of "Kiss" and "When Doves Cry". Despite these refusals, Yankovic was able to gain permission to parody the "When Doves Cry" video as part of his music video for the song "UHF".
392	Paul McCartney, also a Yankovic fan, refused Yankovic permission to record a parody of Wings' "Live and Let Die", titled "Chicken Pot Pie", because, according to Yankovic, McCartney is "a strict vegetarian and he didn't want a parody that condoned the consumption of animal flesh". Though McCartney suggested possibly changing the parody to "Tofu Pot Pie", Yankovic, who is also a vegetarian, found this wouldn't fit the lyrics he had written, which featured the sound of a chicken throughout the chorus. While never recorded for an album, Yankovic did play parts of "Chicken Pot Pie" as part of a larger medley in several tours during the 1990s.
393	In 2006, Yankovic gained James Blunt's permission to record a parody of "You're Beautiful". However, after Yankovic had recorded "You're Pitiful", Blunt's label, Atlantic Records, rescinded this permission, despite Blunt's personal approval of the song. The parody was pulled from Yankovic's Straight Outta Lynwood because of his label's unwillingness to "go to war" with Atlantic. Yankovic released the song as a free download on his MySpace profile, as well as his official website, and plays it in concert, since it was not Blunt himself objecting to the parody. Yankovic referenced the incident in his video for "White & Nerdy" when he depicts himself vandalizing Atlantic Records' Wikipedia article.
394	Yankovic often describes his live concert performances as "a rock and comedy multimedia extravaganza" with an audience that "ranges from toddlers to geriatrics". Apart from Yankovic and his band performing his classic and contemporary hits, staples of Yankovic's live performances include a medley of parodies, many costume changes between songs, and a video screen on which various clips are played during the costume changes. A concert from Yankovic's 1999 tour, "Touring with Scissors", for the Running with Scissors album was released on VHS in 1999 and on DVD in 2000. Titled "Weird Al" Yankovic Live!, the concert was recorded at the Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California, on October 2, 1999. For legal reasons, video clips (apart from those for Yankovic's own music videos) could not be shown for the home release, and unreleased parodies were removed from the parody medley for the performance.
395	Following the release of Mandatory Fun, Yankovic toured across the United States, Canada, and selected overseas venues in the "Mandatory World Tour" from 2015 through 2016, principally featuring songs from this album. After taking a year off, Yankovic returned to tour in the United States and Canada from February to June 2018 in "The Ridiculously Self-Indulgent, Ill-Advised Vanity Tour". On this tour, he performed mostly original songs (not parodies) and did not use costumes, props, or video screens. Comedian Emo Philips was the opening act. A further staple of this tour was Yankovic's cover performance of a different famous song at each venue, which Yankovic stated was something he and his band enjoyed doing.
396	Starting in June 2019, Yankovic went on his "Strings Attached Tour", where he performed every show backed by a forty-one piece orchestra assembled from local musicians. The tour was inspired by a 2016 performance he did with the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra, which he considered a "religious experience" and sought to replicate on tour. The shows were generally much shorter, as under unions rules Yankovic could only perform 90 minutes per show with an orchestra, requiring him to select songs that he felt would be ones that he had either long wanted to with an orchestra, such as the deep-cut "Harvey the Wonder Hamster" from Alapalooza, or that fit best with the orchestra backing. Yankovic had the shows open with the orchestra performing a few instrumental themes, seemingly giving the concert a high-brow quality, before he and his band entered and played his songs backed by the orchestra. The concerts finished with a large flashy production around Star Wars, including his songs The Saga Begins and Yoda.
397	With "Word Crimes" from Mandatory Fun debuting at No. 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2014, Yankovic became the third musical artist after Michael Jackson and Madonna to have a song in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 over each decade since the 1980s, his other Top 40 songs being "Eat It", "Smells Like Nirvana", and "White & Nerdy". Since then, only U2 and Kenny G have also entered this elite group. Billboard named Yankovic #15 of the top 100 music video artists of all time in an August 2020 compilation, addressing that alongside his musical fame, "his accompanying video parodies are a vital part of the recipe".
398	In 1989, Yankovic starred in a full-length feature film called UHF, co-written by himself and manager Jay Levey and filmed in Tulsa, Oklahoma. A satire of the television and film industries, also starring Michael Richards, Fran Drescher, and Victoria Jackson, it brought floundering studio Orion their highest test scores since the movie RoboCop. However, it was unsuccessful in theaters due to both poor critical reception and competition from other summer blockbusters at the time such as Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Lethal Weapon 2, Batman and Licence to Kill. The failure of the film left Yankovic in a three-year slump, which was later broken by his inspiration to compose "Smells Like Nirvana".
399	The film has since become a cult classic, with out-of-print copies of the VHS version selling for up to $100 on eBay until the release of the DVD in 2002. Yankovic occasionally shows clips from the film at his concerts (to which MGM, the film's current owner, initially objected in the form of a cease and desist letter). In an apparent attempt to make it more accessible to overseas audiences, where the term UHF is used less frequently to describe TV broadcasts, the film was titled The Vidiot From UHF in Australia and parts of Europe.
400	The Weird Al Show was a live action skit-based children's show hosted by Yankovic, airing from September to December 1997 on CBS, which featured several actors and bands as guests along with Yankovic and other actors. It was designed to be part of CBS's mandated Educational or Informative programming to teach children morals. The show had a troubled production due to this requirement and the desire by CBS to follow in the success of Pee-wee's Playhouse, leading to the show's cancellation after one 13-episode season. The entire series was released on DVD by Shout! Factory on August 15, 2006.
401	VH1 produced a Behind the Music episode on Yankovic. His two commercial failures (his film UHF and his 1986 album Polka Party!) were presented as having a larger impact on the direction of his career than they really had. Also, Coolio's later disapproval of "Amish Paradise" was played up as a large feud. Much was also made over his apparent lack of a love life, though he got married shortly after the program aired. The episode was updated and re-released in early 2012 as part of the "Behind the Music Remastered" series.
402	Yankovic has done voice-overs for several animated series. He appeared in a 2003 episode of The Simpsons, singing "The Ballad of Homer & Marge" (a parody of John Mellencamp's "Jack & Diane") with his band. The episode, "Three Gays of the Condo", in which Marge hires Yankovic to sing the aforementioned song to Homer in an attempt to reconcile their marriage, later won an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Animated Program (For Programming Less Than One Hour)". Yankovic also had a cameo in a 2008 episode, titled "That '90s Show", during which he records a parody of Homer's grunge hit "Shave Me" titled "Brain Freeze" (Homer's song, "Shave Me", was itself a parody of Nirvana's "Rape Me") making Yankovic one of only a handful of celebrities to appear twice on the show playing themselves.
403	Yankovic had a guest appearance voicing Wreck-Gar, a waste collection vehicle Transformer in the Transformers: Animated cartoon series; previously, Yankovic's "Dare to Be Stupid" song was featured in the 1986 animated film The Transformers: The Movie, during the sequence in which the Wreck-Gar character was first introduced; as such, the song is referenced in the episode. He also plays local TV talent show host Uncle Muscles on several episodes of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! along with other appearances on the show. Weird Al has also supplied the voice of one-shot character 'Petroleum Joe' on The Brak Show. He also voiced himself on a Back at the Barnyard episode, and he appeared as a ringmaster who helps the regular characters of Yo Gabba Gabba! organize a circus in a 2007 episode of the children's show.
404	In 2011, Al appeared as himself in the Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode "Bat-Mite Presents: Batman's Strangest Cases!" In 2012, Al was extensively featured in the sixth season episode of 30 Rock called "Kidnapped by Danger", where Jenna tries to come up with a "Weird Al-proof" song, as well as appearing on two episodes of The Aquabats! Super Show!, playing two different characters as the superhero SuperMagic PowerMan and as the President of the United States. In 2014, he appeared in the fourth season My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic episode "Pinkie Pride" as Cheese Sandwich, a rival party planner to Pinkie Pie. He would later reprise his role in the season 9 episode "The Last Laugh".
405	Eric Appel produced a Funny or Die movie trailer for Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, a fictional biographical film that parodies other films based on musicians; Yankovic (played by Aaron Paul) is seen hiding his "weirdness" from his parents (Gary Cole and Mary Steenburgen), making it big using song parodies with the help of Dr. Demento (Patton Oswalt), falling in and out of love with Madonna (Olivia Wilde), and fading into alcoholism and being arrested, at which point his father finally admits he is "weird" as well. Yankovic himself plays a music producer in the short. Yankovic later appeared in another Funny or Die short alongside Huey Lewis which parodied the ax murder scene in the movie American Psycho, in which Christian Bale's character Patrick Bateman discusses the nature of Lewis's musical work before killing his victim.
406	Yankovic wrote, directed and starred in the short 3-D movie attraction "Al's Brain: A 3-D Journey Through The Human Brain", a $2.5 million project which was sponsored by and premiered at the Orange County Fair in Costa Mesa, California, in 2009. The project included a brief cameo by Sir Paul McCartney, which Yankovic directed during McCartney's appearance at the 2009 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Fair CEO Steve Beazley, who supported the project, considered the project a success and explored leasing the exhibit to other fairs; the second appearance of the exhibit was at the 2009 Puyallup Fair in Washington.
407	On January 25, 2010, Yankovic announced that he had signed a production deal with Warner Bros. to write and direct a live-action feature film for Cartoon Network. Although Yankovic previously wrote the script for UHF, this was to be the first movie Yankovic directed. Yankovic stated that he would not be starring in the movie, as Cartoon Network wanted a younger protagonist. During an interview on Comedy Death-Ray Radio, Yankovic revealed that though Cartoon Network "loved" his script, the network decided that they were no longer intending to produce feature films. Yankovic initially stated that he would instead shop the script around to other potential studios, but in 2013 revealed that the project had been scrapped as "it was really geared for Cartoon Network" and that he had "cannibalized jokes from that script to use for other projects".
408	Yankovic wrote When I Grow Up, a children's book released on February 1, 2011 and published by HarperCollins. The book features 8-year-old Billy presenting to his class the wide variety of imaginative career possibilities that he is considering. Yankovic stated that the idea for the book was based on his own "circuitous" career path. The book allows Yankovic to apply the humorous writing style found in his music in another medium, allowing him to use puns and rhymes. Yankovic worked with Harper Collins' editor Anne Hoppe—the first time that Yankovic has had an editor—and found her help to be a positive experience. The book is illustrated by Wes Hargis, who, according to Yankovic, has "a childlike quality and a very fun quality and a very imaginative quality" that matched well with Yankovic's writing. The book reached the No. 4 position on The New York Times Best Seller list for Children's Picture Books for the week of February 20, 2011.
409	Songs posted to file sharing networks are often misattributed to him because of their humorous subject matter. Often, his surname is misspelled (and thus mispronounced) as "Yankovich", among other variations. Much to the disdain of Yankovic, these misattributed files include songs that are racist, sexually explicit, or otherwise offensive. A young listener who had heard several of these offensive tracks by way of a file sharing service confronted Yankovic online, threatening a boycott because of his supposedly explicit lyrics. Quite a few of the songs, such as "Star Wars Cantina" by Mark Jonathan Davis (not, in a double misattribution, his lounge-singer character Richard Cheese), "Star Wars Gangsta Rap", "Yoda Smokes Weed", "Chewbacca", "The Devil Went To Jamaica", "The Twelve Pains of Christmas" by Bob Rivers and several more have a Star Wars motif. Some songs misattributed to him are not songs, but spoken skits, such as "Sesame Street on crack", which is also widely misattributed to Adam Sandler. A list of songs frequently misattributed to Yankovic can be found at The Not Al Page and a list of all commercially released songs recorded by Yankovic can be found on his website.
410	"If you do a search for my name on any one of those sites, I guarantee you that about half of the songs that come up will be songs I had absolutely nothing to do with. That particularly bothers me, because I really try to do quality work, and I also try to maintain a more-or-less family-friendly image—and some of these songs that are supposedly by me are just, well, vulgar and awful. I truly think my reputation has suffered in a lot of people's minds because of all those fake Weird Al songs floating around the Internet."
411	The Weird Al Star Fund was a campaign started by Yankovic's fans to get him a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Their mission was to "solicit, collect, and raise the necessary money, and to compile the information needed for the application to nominate "Weird Al" Yankovic for a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame". Fans worldwide have sent donations to raise the US$40,000 needed for a nomination. In addition to the preferred method of cash donations, many methods were used to raise money for the cause, such as a live benefit show held April 11, 2006, and selling merchandise on the official website and eBay, including T-shirts, calendars, and cookbooks. On May 26, 2006, the campaign hit the then-$15,000 target, just five days before the May 31 deadline to submit the necessary paperwork. However, Yankovic was not included on the list of inductees for 2007. On February 9, 2007, the Hollywood Chamber Of Commerce raised the price to sponsor a new star to $25,000. Yankovic's application was resubmitted for consideration in 2007, but he was not included among 2008's inductees. In December 2010, the price was raised again to $30,000. and in 2017 the price was raised to $40,000. The campaign raised the new target each time and applications continued to be submitted yearly, until The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced in June 2017 that Yankovic would receive a star on the Walk of Fame as one of the 2018 inductees.  In an official induction ceremony on August 27, 2018, Al received the 2,643rd star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The star is located at 6914 Hollywood Blvd, directly across the street from TCL Chinese Theatre. The ceremony was attended by 1,500 fans.
412	Similar to the Weird Al Star Fund, a second fan-driven campaign called "Make the Rock Hall 'Weird'" has tried to enshrine him into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio, for which he has been eligible since 2004. Previous attempts to raise awareness for the campaign and support Yankovic's nomination included a petition drive from 2006 to 2007, which raised over 9000 signatures; an art competition in 2005; additionally, a documentary film about the campaign is currently being developed. In addition to these efforts, an ongoing campaign is underway in which supporters of Yankovic's nomination are requested to send "sincere, thoughtful" letters to the Rock Hall Foundation's headquarters in New York. The Hall has not considered Yankovic for nomination since the campaign started in 2004. A 2009 Rolling Stone poll named Weird Al as the top artist that should be nominated for the Hall of Fame, followed by Rush (who were inducted in 2013) and The Moody Blues (inducted in 2018) in the top ten.
413	A smaller ongoing effort has been made by fans to have Yankovic perform at the halftime show of a Super Bowl game. This inspired Yankovic to write the fight song parody "Sports Song" for Mandatory Fun to help round out his repertoire. Subsequent to the success of Mandatory Fun, another fan-driven campaign pushed for Yankovic to headline the then-upcoming Super Bowl XLIX at the highlight of the artist's career, which was noticed by many media outlets, including CNN and Wired, though the decision for this selection would reside within the management of the NFL (who instead chose Katy Perry for that position).
414	The music featured on the album span Yankovic's release in the 1980s, with the earliest songs being recorded in 1983, and the most recent song being recorded in 1988. Yankovic's 1983 debut album is represented solely by "Ricky". Both "Eat It" and "I Lost on Jeopardy" were taken from Yankovic's 1984 release "Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D. Yankovic's third album, Dare to Be Stupid has three songs featured: "Like a Surgeon", the eponymous "Dare to Be Stupid", and "One More Minute". "Living with a Hernia" and "Addicted to Spuds" were culled from the 1986 album Polka Party!. Finally, Yankovic's then-recent studio album Even Worse is represented by "Fat" and "Lasagna".
415	Heather Phares of AllMusic noted that, "though [the album] only covers the first half of "Weird Al" Yankovic's career, it nevertheless features nearly all of his best work". She highlighted "Eat It", "Fat", and "I Lost on Jeopardy" as the album's stand-out tracks, and concluded that the release "is still the most consistent and concise album in his catalog, and a great introduction to his very special brand of musical humor." Fred Cisternia of Amazon.com gave the album a relatively positive review, writing that, "If you want to take a funhouse mirror trip back to the 1980s, Greatest Hits is a good way to do it." Nathan Brackett and Christian Hoard, in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, awarded the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, denoting that the album averaged between good and excellent.
416	After encountering difficulty picking up a record label for the first-time album, Jay Levey (a Los Angeles artists' manager) provided KIQQ-FM with a copy of "I Love Rocky Road". Impressing the program director of the Top 40 station, he played it immediately; "I Love Rocky Road" was one of the most-requested songs by the next day. At the same time, Rock 'n Roll Records president Tad Dowd had been trying to convince parent company Scotti Brothers Records to sign the 22-year-old Yankovic. The positive furor over the KIQQ playtest provided Dowd with the leverage needed to convince Scotti Bros. to offer a contract for Yankovic's first album.
417	"Weird Al" Yankovic is the only album in Yankovic's discography to use the accordion in every song; in subsequent albums it is only used where deemed appropriate or wholly inappropriate for comedic effect. "Ricky" is a parody of "Mickey" by Toni Basil; an ode to I Love Lucy with Yankovic performing as Ricky and Tress MacNeille as Lucy. "Gotta Boogie" is a play on words discussing a man with a "boogie" on his finger and his quandary therein. "I Love Rocky Road" is a parody of Arrows' "I Love Rock 'n' Roll" made famous by Joan Jett; in the song the narrator expresses feelings about the titular ice cream flavor. "Buckingham Blues" is a blues song satirizing the socialite lifestyle of the Prince and Princess of Wales (Prince Charles and Diana). Originally, the song was going to be a parody of "Jack & Diane" by John Mellencamp; worried about spoiling a Jack and Diane movie deal, Mellencamp shot down the parody. Yankovic considered tweaking the "Jack & Diane" melody to avoid the song being a true parody, but decided against it and later rewrote it as an original song. Answering a fan in 1998, Yankovic replied that he would not rewrite and rerecord the song in light of the death of Diana.
418	"Happy Birthday" is a style parody of Tonio K, one of Yankovic's favorite artists. The song is a morbidly depressing birthday song detailing ails of the world, including poverty, nuclear holocaust, and eventual solar cataclysm. Only seeing two popular birthday songs at the time—"Happy Birthday to You" by Patty and Mildred J. Hill, and "Birthday" by The Beatles—Yankovic decided to write his own "severely twisted version of one." "Stop Draggin' My Car Around" is a parody of "Stop Draggin' My Heart Around" by Stevie Nicks; the lament of an otherwise "cool guy" forced to repeatedly save his 1964 Plymouth car from impoundment due to illegal parking, shame, and non-payment. "My Bologna" is a parody of "My Sharona" by the Knack; the narrator talks about his obsession with bologna sausage. This is a re-recording of the song; the original Capitol Records single version would not appear on a "Weird Al" album until the 1994 box set Permanent Record: Al in the Box. "The Check's in the Mail" parodies business-related prevarications, exampling avoidance, litigation, and the titular payment delay. "Another One Rides the Bus" is a parody of "Another One Bites the Dust" by Queen; the narrator laments about a crowded public bus. This is the original 1980 recording from The Dr. Demento Show. "I'll Be Mellow When I'm Dead" is a rejection of the stereotypical attitudes and accoutrements of the hippie/yuppie lifestyles.
419	"Such a Groovy Guy" parodies narcissism specifically noting fashion, demeanor, dominance and submission, and relationship breakup. Yankovic wrote the song for a woman he was dating in homage of her previous boyfriend who, upon the breakup asked her, "I’m such a groovy guy! Why would you break up with me?" Out of concern the individual may not be aware of his status, Yankovic does not identify him. "Mr. Frump in the Iron Lung" is an audience favorite from Yankovic's days playing in coffeehouses at Cal Poly; the song describes the rather lopsided relationship between the narrator and the eponymous "Mr. Frump" in his iron lung, until the latter's death. The sound of the iron lung is an accordion's air release valve. "It's Still Billy Joel to Me", Yankovic's 1980 parody of Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me", was originally planned for this album. Wary of the song being considered "dated" three years later, and doubtful that Joel would give his blessing, the band never bothered to ask. Yankovic's parody of The Kinks' song "Lola"—"Yoda"—was written in 1980 (during the initial theatre run of The Empire Strikes Back), and a "huge hit" on The Dr. Demento Show. However, the complexities of receiving permission from filmmaker George Lucas and the Kinks' publishers delayed its release until 1985.
420	Eugene Chadbourne, reviewer for AllMusic, felt that while "Weird Al" Yankovic was a detailed harbinger of parody to come, the album does not hold up well on its own. Chadbourne extolled most of the parodies ("Another One Rides the Bus", "My Bologna", "I Love Rocky Road") for their comedic value in contrast with their originals—songs he supposed to be "pretentious [&] overblown". However, also according to Chadbourne, "Ricky" lacks the comedic connection Yankovic cultivates in later albums, and the original songs "may not seem like they were written in ten minutes, but the ideas behind them don't seem to involve that much contemplation. [They're] like little bits of puff [whose ...] impact on the flow of an album side is more like ballast."
421	Introducing Yankovic as the guest DJ for All Songs Considered on National Public Radio in 2006, host Bob Boilen opined that upon his debut, Yankovic "seemed the epitome of throw-away novelty act". Reviewing Yankovic in 2008, Brian Raftery of Wired magazine wrote that "Ricky" introduced the world to "an accordion-playing spaz with a coif like Rick James and a voice like an urgent goose."  Raftery noted that in 1983, Yankovic was considered a fad of the time—"like parachute pants and Contras"—and "thoroughly disposable." Musical databasing and review websites AllMusic and Artistdirect rated "Weird Al" Yankovic three and a half out of five stars.
422	The discography of American singer, songwriter, musician and parodist "Weird Al" Yankovic consists of fourteen studio albums, ten compilation albums, eleven video albums, two extended plays, forty-six singles and fifty-four music videos. Since the debut of his first comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums—more than any other comedy act in history—recorded more than 150 parody and original songs, and performed more than 1,000 live shows. His works have earned him five Grammy Awards among sixteen nominations, along with several gold and platinum record certifications in the United States. Yankovic's first single, "My Bologna", was released in 1979, and he made his chart debut two years later with his second single, "Another One Rides the Bus", which peaked at number four on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. His self-titled debut studio album was released on Scotti Brothers Records in April 1983, peaking at number 16 on the US Billboard 200 and being certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Ricky", the album's third single, became his first single to chart on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 64.
423	"Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D followed in February 1984. It peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200 and was certified platinum by the RIAA, while also charting in Australia and Canada. The album's lead single "Eat It" was a commercial success, topping the Australian singles chart and also reaching the top 15 in Canada and the United States. Follow-up singles "King of Suede" and "I Lost on Jeopardy" peaked at numbers 62 and 81 respectively on the Hot 100. Yankovic's third studio album Dare to Be Stupid, released in June 1985, peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200 and produced six singles, the most successful being the Hot 100 hit "Like a Surgeon". Issued in October 1986, his fourth studio album Polka Party! charted at a disappointing number 177 on the Billboard 200, with the album and its accompanying singles failing to match the commercial success of Yankovic's previous work. His fifth studio album, released in April 1988, Even Worse fared better commercially, peaking at number 27 on the Billboard 200 and earning him a minor chart hit with the single "Fat". Released later in October 1988 was Peter and the Wolf, a collaboration with American composer Wendy Carlos.
424	In 1989, Yankovic starred in and recorded the soundtrack for the 1989 film UHF. The soundtrack album was released in July 1989, charting at number 146 on the Billboard 200. Released in April 1992, Yankovic's seventh studio album Off the Deep End helped revitalize his career after a decline in commercial success in the late 1980s, peaking at number 17 on the Billboard 200, earning a platinum certification from the RIAA, and producing the Billboard top 40 hit "Smells Like Nirvana". Alapalooza, his eighth studio album, was released in October 1993; it peaked at number 46 on the Billboard 200. Bad Hair Day, Yankovic's ninth studio album was released in April 1996, peaked at numbers 9 and 14 respectively on the Canadian Albums Chart and Billboard 200. "Amish Paradise", the album's lead single, peaked at number 53 on the Billboard Hot 100.
425	After signing to new label Volcano Records, Yankovic released his tenth studio album Running with Scissors in June 1999. The album peaked at number 16 on the Billboard 200 and produced a minor Australian chart hit, "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi". Poodle Hat, his eleventh studio album, was released in May 2003 and peaked at number 17 on the Billboard 200. Straight Outta Lynwood was released in September 2006 and peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, becoming Yankovic's first top ten album on the chart. He also scored his first top ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100 with the album's lead single "White & Nerdy". Alpocalypse was released in June 2011 and peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200, and Mandatory Fun followed in July 2014. The latter became Yankovic's first number-one album on the chart, with first-week sales of 104,000 copies.
426	The album is built around parodies and pastiches of pop and rock music of the mid-1980s. Half of the album is made up of parodies of artists like Michael Jackson, Men Without Hats, the Greg Kihn Band, the Police, and Survivor. The other half of the album contains many "style parodies", musical imitations that come close to, but do not directly copy a specific work by, existing artists. These style parodies include imitations of artists like Bob Marley and the B-52s. This album marked a musical departure from Yankovic's self-titled debut, in that the arrangements of the parodies were now closer to the originals. Also, the accordion was no longer used in every song, but only  where deemed appropriate or comically inappropriate. The album is also notable for being the first album released by Yankovic to include a polka medley of hit songs. These pastiches of hit songs, set to polka music, have since appeared on nearly all of Yankovic's albums.
427	"Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D was met with mostly positive reviews and peaked at number seventeen on the Billboard 200 and number sixty-one in Australia. The album also produced one of Yankovic's most famous singles, "Eat It" (a parody of Michael Jackson's "Beat It"), which peaked at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100. This song was Yankovic's highest charting single until "White & Nerdy" from his 2006 album Straight Outta Lynwood peaked at number nine in the October 21, 2006 Billboard charts. "Eat It" also charted at number one in Australia, making it Yankovic's only number one single in any country. The album also produced two minor US hits, "King of Suede", which peaked at number sixty-two, and "I Lost on Jeopardy", which peaked at number eighty-one. The album was Yankovic's first Gold record, and went on to be certified Platinum for sales of over one million copies in the United States. "Eat It" won a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Performance Single or Album, Spoken or Musical in 1985.
428	In October 1983, Yankovic began recording his second album at Santa Monica Sound Recorders, in Santa Monica, California. To produce it, he brought in former The McCoys guitarist Rick Derringer, who also produced Yankovic's first album. Backing Yankovic were Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz on drums, Steve Jay on bass, and Jim West on guitar. During the first recording session for the album, five original songs were recorded: "Nature Trail to Hell", "Mr. Popeil", "Buy Me a Condo", "Midnight Star", and "That Boy Could Dance". Two months later, Yankovic began recording the five parodies and polka medley that would appear on the album: "Eat It", "King of Suede", "I Lost on Jeopardy", "Theme from Rocky XIII (The Rye or the Kaiser)", "The Brady Bunch", and "Polkas on 45".
429	Every song on Yankovic's debut album was played on an accordion, accompanied by bass, guitar, and drums. On In 3-D Yankovic decided to restrict the accordion to certain sections, most notably the polka medley "Polkas on 45". In the "Ask Al" section on his web site, Yankovic explained: "Nowadays, I only use it on original songs where I feel an accordion is appropriate, and on parody songs where I feel an accordion is [comically] inappropriate ... and of course, on the polka medleys. I'm not really downplaying the accordion at all – I usually feature the accordion on three or four songs every album, which is three or four more accordion-based songs than most Top 40 albums have!"
430	One of the first originals recorded for the album was "Midnight Star", a loving ode to fictional supermarket tabloids. The liner notes to Permanent Record state that a Weekly World News article about the "Incredible Frog Boy" helped to inspire the song. According to Yankovic, most of the tabloid headlines were real. He spent several weeks collecting and looking through old tabloids to find inane titles. Initially he thought that "Midnight Star" should have been the lead single for the album, but later relented and released "Eat It" instead. "Buy Me a Condo" is a style parody of Bob Marley and the reggae genre in general.
431	"Mr. Popeil" is a song discussing the inventor Sam Popeil (the father of inventor Ron Popeil) and his myriad inventions of varying usefulness. Musically, it is a style parody of the B-52s, something that Robert Christgau once said "exploits Yankovic's otherwise fatal resemblance to Fred Schneider." One of the backing vocalists on the track is Ron Popeil's sister Lisa Popeil. When recording the song, Yankovic came across an article about Lisa Popeil and her singing career; later he asked her if she would be interested in appearing in the song, to which she agreed.
432	The last original song to be recorded for the album was "Nature Trail to Hell", about a fictional slasher film "in 3-D"; 3D film had enjoyed a brief resurgence in 1981–83, with the likes of Parasite, Friday the 13th Part III and Amityville 3-D being successful 3-D horrors. At the 3:40 mark, the song has a backward message that says "Satan eats Cheez Whiz!" This, in turn, was a parody of the Satanic backmasking scare during the early 1980s. Online magazine Pitchfork Media has alluded to the song several times, once comparing it to "Thrill Kill" by The Damned, and another time sarcastically calling the song a "classic".
433	On the same day that "The Brady Bunch" was recorded, Yankovic started working on "I Lost on Jeopardy", a parody of "Jeopardy" by the Greg Kihn Band. The song describes a situation in which the narrator loses spectacularly on the game show Jeopardy!. Show announcer Don Pardo lends his voice to a segment of the song. In order to create the parody, Yankovic cleared the idea not only with Greg Kihn, but also with Merv Griffin, who created the show. Don Pardo, Art Fleming, and Kihn all appeared in the music video. Kihn, the composer of the original song, was extremely pleased and flattered by the parody. In 2009, Kihn wrote a blog on his MySpace called "Weird Al and Mailbox Money", in which he complimented Yankovic's comedy and explained the mechanics of how a parody works. Kihn referred to the royalty checks he still receives from "I Lost on Jeopardy" as "Mailbox Money".
434	The next parodies to be recorded were "Theme from Rocky XIII (The Rye or the Kaiser)", a parody of Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" about a washed-up Rocky Balboa, who now runs a deli and occasionally beats up on the liverwurst; and "King of Suede", a parody of the Police's "King of Pain", about a clothing store owner who claims the titular title. In order to research information for the latter, Yankovic would walk around in fabric stores taking notes. He later remarked, "I got a lot of nasty stares from store managers."
435	The final parody recorded for the album was "Eat It", a parody of Michael Jackson's "Beat It", about an exasperated parent's quest to get their picky child to eat right. Yankovic formulated the idea during a brainstorming session between himself, Robert K. Weiss, and his manager Jay Levey. They were bouncing ideas off one another until suddenly "[they] had the whole thing written." Although he knew that the best way to get permission to parody a song was through the official songwriter, Yankovic was unsure what type of reaction he would get from Jackson when presented with the parody lyrics. However, Jackson allegedly thought it was a "funny idea", and allowed the parody. In the mockumentary The Compleat Al, there is a scene portraying the fictitious meeting of Yankovic and Jackson. Musically, the parody is slightly different from the original, being set in a changed key, comic sound effects, and an Eddie Van Halen-inspired guitar solo from Yankovic's producer Rick Derringer.
436	"Eat It" was Yankovic's first—and, until "Smells Like Nirvana" (1992), his only—Top Forty hit, peaking at number twelve on the Billboard Hot 100. It was also Yankovic's highest-charting single until "White & Nerdy" reached number nine on the October 21, 2006, Billboard chart. "Eat It" was a worldwide hit, even managing to peak at number one in Australia. For many years, Yankovic became known colloquially as "The 'Eat It' guy." He referred to this sarcastically on his own personal Twitter; at one point, Al's description was, "You know ... the Eat It guy."
437	One of the last songs recorded for the album was "Polkas on 45". The song, whose title is a take on the novelty act Stars on 45, is a medley of popular rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s. "Polkas on 45" evolved from an early polka medley that Yankovic had played when opening for new wave band Missing Persons in 1981. This early version included parts of various new wave songs, including "Jocko Homo" by Devo, "Homosapien" by Pete Shelley, "Sex Junkie" by Plasmatics, "T.V.O.D." by The Normal, "Bad Boys Get Spanked" by The Pretenders, "TV Party" by Black Flag, "Janitor" by Suburban Lawns, and "People Who Died" by Jim Carroll. After being asked how he picked the songs to include, Yankovic responded, "I just pick songs that sound slightly better done polka style—the way God intended."
438	The album received a score of four and a half stars from AllMusic, with Eugene Chadbourne saying, "With an album behind him, Weird Al Yankovic makes much of the improvements expected of new artists when they get a second crack at a release a year later." Christopher Thelen from The Daily Vault wrote that "All in all, this disc held out the promise that Yankovic was destined for greatness ..." In addition, "Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D was also named one of the Year's Top 10 Albums in 1984 by People magazine. Den of Geek even named In 3-D as one of the "10 Reasons Why 1984 Was a Great Year for Geek Movies"—despite it not being a movie. On November 1, 2011, Spin magazine named In 3-D as the seventeenth greatest comedy album of all time.
439	Parody-wise, Yankovic still always managed to throw a different loop into the music to make it sound different than the song it was based on. (I happen to like the fact that Yankovic now writes parodies to sound exactly like the original song.) As a result, "Theme From Rocky XIII" doesn't have the crispness as the original song from Survivor did, "The Brady Bunch" is sped up (in both tempo and pitch) from Men Without Hats's "The Safety Dance", and "Eat It" takes Michael Jackson's "Beat It" and raises the pitch.
440	"Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D was released on February 28, 1984. On April 28, it peaked at number 17, where it remained for three consecutive weeks. In 3-D spent a total of twenty-three weeks on the chart. It was also successful in Australia, where it peaked at number 61 on the album chart. Many of the album's singles also went on to be successful. "Eat It" eventually sold over a half a million copies, peaked at number twelve domestically on the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified Gold. It was also a worldwide hit, peaking at number thirty-six in the United Kingdom and number one in Australia. As of March 2012, "Eat It" is currently Yankovic's only number one single in any country. "King of Suede" and "I Lost on Jeopardy", the album's follow up singles, peaked on the Hot 100 at numbers 61 and 82 respectively.
441	 "Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!"  is a political satire comedy album by Earle Doud and Alen Robin, released in November 1965 on Capitol Records. The vinyl album uses out-of-context recordings of political figures apparently responding to interview questions fabricated by the comedians. Television comedy writers Earle Doud and Alen Robin conduct some of the "interviews"; other interviewers are news announcers John Cameron Swayze and Westbrook Van Voorhis, with WPIX anchorman John St. Leger, all of whom were recorded speaking questions written by Doud and Robin. Audio tape was edited to bring together the comedy questions and the recordings of political people, with laugh track sound effects added by Bob Prescott.
442	In 1964 when they started the project, Earle Doud and Alen Robin were both veterans of television comedy writing. Doud had written funny lines for Jack Paar, Jackie Gleason, Jonathan Winters, Ernie Kovacs and Johnny Carson, while Robin was a long-time writer on The Tonight Show who had also supplied comedy hooks for Cliff Arquette, Fred Allen and Steve Allen. Doud and Robin were frustrated with the anonymous work of comedy writing, and they were looking for a way to earn greater fame. Doud had already come near stardom when he helped impersonator Vaughn Meader become famous overnight with the 1962 comedy album The First Family, which poked gentle fun at the Kennedy family. Robin said he was searching for a way to make more money; he found it difficult to consort with TV stars in the way they expected of him.
443	Robin and Doud gathered many recorded interviews of political figures, their collection eventually amounting to 36 miles (58 km) of magnetic tape. They had originally intended to introduce the album earlier but were prevented by the daunting task of editing the recordings. Broadcast announcer Chester Santon later speculated that Robin and Doud first attempted to compile recordings of the Lyndon B. Johnson family alone, but cast their net wider when they did not find enough funny material. Robin and Doud finally settled on an album containing American political figures, which meant they would have to set aside recordings of German rocketry pioneer Wernher von Braun, and Prince Philip of England.
444	Robin met with Doud nearly every evening for 13 months in Doud's New York City house in the East 60s of the Upper East Side neighborhood, to ferret out the best potential comedy material. They were watched by Doud's pet kinkajou (a small rainforest mammal) which was sometimes intoxicated on alcohol supplied by Doud. They looked for recordings that would fit with the idea of a press conference or interview. Doud said, "We tried to stay away from the tapes of speeches because we wanted the tone which comes only in interviews." They had funny possibilities with words spoken by ex-President Harry S. Truman, but the recording quality was poor, so they decided not to use it. More humorous moments were captured in recordings of Ambassador Adlai Stevenson II, but he died in July 1965, so Doud felt it would be in bad taste to include him. With Truman and Stevenson removed, Doud and Robin's intended balance of five Republicans and five Democrats was reduced to five and three.
445	Doud said that all of the answers heard on the album were taken whole from source material rather than cut up and reassembled word-by-word. The title of the album is a recorded snippet of Lady Bird Johnson conducting a tour of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Texas home which is now a national historic park. Doud and Robin used her voice to answer a comedic question about what the native Americans might have said to Christopher Columbus. Another contrast used for laughs by the writers was wealthy Governor Nelson Rockefeller being asked what he gave his wife for their anniversary, with the recorded reply, "The State of New York, the State of New Jersey, the State of Connecticut... and all the people in those states."
446	When it came out in November 1965, excerpts from the 331⁄3 rpm, 12-inch microgroove LP were played on US radio stations in many metropolitan areas, which stimulated sales. The album sold so well that Capitol executive Brown Meggs said in November 1965 that they were planning on selling 4 million units through the end of the year, while Cash Box magazine reported they had already sold 5 million. On Christmas Day 1965, Billboard magazine listed "Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!" at number 3 of the top selling LPs in the US, following Whipped Cream & Other Delights by Herb Alpert at number 1, and The Sound of Music film soundtrack album. This was the fifth week LBJ Ranch had been on the chart. The album stayed on the chart for 25 weeks in total.
447	Cash Box described how some of the larger major metropolitan radio stations were hesitant to broadcast excerpts because of the fear that the material was violating the rights of the politicians. Capitol Records had already given the album to their 40-person legal team who had cleared it as fair use because it was a parody. Radio stations playing the comedy tracks included WMCA in New York, WLS and WCFL in Chicago, WJW in Cleveland, WWDC in Baltimore/Washington, D.C., KJR in Seattle, KLIF in Dallas, and three in Atlanta: WSB,  WYZE and WQXI. Meggs said that the album ran into "stiff resistance" from Los Angeles radio stations.
448	"Welcome to the LBJ Ranch!" was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category of Best Comedy Album. For the 8th Annual Grammy Awards held in March 1966, Doud and Robin were up against albums by Godfrey Cambridge and the Smothers Brothers, and they were competing with Doud's former colleagues from the 1962 album The First Family: producers Bob Booker and George Foster with their new album You Don't Have to Be Jewish. In the end, Bill Cosby won the comedy award for Why Is There Air? The National Association of Recording Merchandisers (NARM) listed LBJ Ranch in a group of six nominated for the Best-Selling Comedy Album of 1965, and Cash Box later reported it certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
449	He achieved notoriety in Tamil Nadu after the attack on lawyer R. Shanmugasundaram which happened on 30 May 1995. "Welding" Kumar became a household name when the CBI offered Rs. 3000 for information leading to his arrest. The DMK lawyer R. Shanmugasundaram was preparing a case against the then Chief Minister Jayalalitha in the TANSI land scam case. The attack which left him severely injured infuriated the law community in Tamil Nadu and evoked statewide protests. Kumar was subsequently convicted in that case by a local court and sent to life in prison. The ruling was later confirmed by the High court.
450	Writing in Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Gordon J. Horwitz called the book "perceptive and closely argued" and a "carefully researched analytical study". He also praised it for dealing sensitively with the testimonies that comprise its source material. In AJS Review, Cichopek-Gajraj also praised the book, writing that it was  "a uniquely readable, remarkably affecting, and truly original text that is a must read" for people interested in Polish-Jewish relations, and she called it "one of the best books on the subject in recent years". In the Slavic Review, Rachel Brenner wrote that the work is a "well-researched  and  interesting  book" and "a  serious, well-done study which makes an important contribution to the field of Holocaust studies".
451	"Whispering" Bill Anderson was recorded in March 1974 at Bradley's Barn, a studio located in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. The sessions were produced by Owen Bradley, Anderson's longtime musical collaborator. It was Anderson's twenty second album project and the twenty second to be recorded with Bradley. The album's title was derived from a nickname given to Anderson early in his career. The title was given to him because of the "whisper" quality of his singing voice. The album consisted of 11 tracks. Seven of the album's songs were written co-written by Anderson himself. The additional four track were written by others. The track, "Country Song", was written by Jack Clement, a Nashville music producer. The opening track, "Can I Come Home to You", was co-written by Jan Crutchfield and producer Buddy Killen.
452	"Whispering" Bill Anderson was released in June 1974 on MCA Records, his twenty-second studio recording. The album was issued as a vinyl LP record, with six songs on side one and five songs on side two of the record. The project peaked at number 17 on the Billboard Top Country Albums in September 1974. The album included one single, "Can I Come Home to You". Released in 1974, the song peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart after spending 14 weeks on the chart. The project received a positive response from Billboard in June 1974. "Again, a great collection of material sung in the Anderson style which puts him consistently at the top. It's a great variety of songs, including a little recitation, some fine ballads, an up-tempo tune or two, and real class," staff writers commented.
453	Brill has been taking people on nature walks in New York's Central Park, and parks throughout the Greater NY area, since 1982. Brill says his tours had the approval of the parks department until they began refusing to issue him a weed-picking permit in 1983. He gained notoriety in 1986 when he was arrested by two undercover park rangers and charged with criminal mischief after allegedly eating a dandelion he had picked in New York's Central Park. Brill was released with a "desk-appearance ticket" pending trial. According to Brill, the New York City Parks Department "dropped the charges and hired me to lead the same tours I was busted for" until a change in park administration in 1990.
454	In an interview with NPR on August 20, 2017, Grafton stated the basis of the book was an amalgamation of two actual events: "The origin was a case that happened in Santa Barbara, where a kid was picked up because his brother owed $1,500 to a drug dealer. And eventually, he was shot and killed up in the mountains. Second part of the plot was from a case down in Orange County, where some kids –always kids– assaulted a girl and filmed it and then circulated this bunch of photographs, which she knew nothing about until somebody told her. So they ended up going to court. So I juxtaposed the two."
455	""Yume" ~Mugen no Kanata~" is the major debut single and fifth overall single release by ViViD, release under Sony Music Entertainment's sub label EPIC Records. The single was released in three different versions: two limited CD+DVD editions (A+B) and a regular CD only edition. Both limited editions come with the title song's PV; limited edition A contains three live performances taken from their August 8th, 2010 live show at Shibuya-AX, while limited edition B comes with a live performance of "Take-off". The regular edition comes with another B-side song, titled "risk". The title track was used as an ending theme song for the anime "Level E". The single reached #6 on the Oricon weekly charts, where it charted for eight weeks.
456	The single was released in two versions; an "F" Edition (『F』盤) and a "Z" Edition (『Z』盤). The "F" Edition contains two tracks and their instrumental versions, a Blu-ray Disc of the title track's music video and has cover art depicting the group's members dressed as Dragon Ball character Freeza, while the back cover has a similar image as it would be seen through one of the series' "Scouter" devices. The "Z" Edition includes a cover of Dragon Ball Z's original opening theme song, "Cha-La Head-Cha-La" by Hironobu Kageyama, and an instrumental version in addition to the previous four tracks, with front and back cover art illustrations depicting the members in a Dragon Ball-style drawn by Toei Animation.
457	As Jeanne Louise Victoire was close in age to the Dauphin, Marie Antoinette decided to adopt her and keep her in the royal household so that she could function as a playmate of the Dauphin in the same manner as her elder foster daughter  Ernestine Lambriquet functioned as a playmate of her daughter Marie Thérèse of France. As she had done with her previous adoptive children, the queen gave Jeanne Louise Victoire a new name: "Zoë". Her two elder sisters were, however, sent to a convent boarding school on the queen's expense. 
458	Reception to the song has been in general positive. Antônio Carlos Miguel, in a review of Dois for Jornal da Tarde, considered the song the album's "most fascinating" one. He said: "In a hypnotic take, repeating the same musical theme, he [Russo] attempts to translate the first and real owners of Brazil's despair (...) Works such as this one, uniting pleasure and awareness, could even contribute to the thriving of the last indigenous people. Or show the so-called civilized people that we can still learn a lot with the innocence of these peoples".
459	The building used to be based on two ramshackle walls of a former transformer station built in the 1920s. Today the theatre building consists of two distinct and organically linked units: the reconstructed and refurbished building of the transformer station (room and stage) and the administrative building made of glass, metal and plastics. The reconstruction was led by the Baku architect Oqtay Sattarov while the decorations of the interior of ÜNS were done by the artist Altay Sadygzade. The sound, light, video and stage have been elaborated and installed by one of the Russian companies.
460	ÜNS has also staged its own drama performances based on the plays written specifically for the theatre- “Final Restaurant” by Magsud Ibrahimbeyov, “Shakespeare” by Elchin Efendiyev, musicals “Baku” and “Notre-Drame de Paris”. The theatre has also hosted recitals, concerts and exhibitions. Many people still recall the unforgettable performances by Russian director Roman Viktuk- the plays “Edith Piaf, My Legionnaire” and “Trees die while standing” based on the play by Alejandro Casona. The Theatre has also hosted concerts by French musicians of Arab origin who performed oriental music in a new style, the performances of a Corsican ethnic choir, concerts of the jazz pianist Shahin Novrasli and many others.
461	"'And He Built a Crooked House'" is a science fiction short story by American writer Robert A. Heinlein, first published in Astounding Science Fiction in February 1941. It was reprinted in the anthology Fantasia Mathematica (Clifton Fadiman, ed.) in 1958 and in the Heinlein collection The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag in 1959.  The story is about a mathematically inclined architect named Quintus Teal who has what he thinks is a brilliant idea to save on real estate costs by building a house shaped like the unfolded net of a tesseract. The title is paraphrased from the nursery rhyme "There Was a Crooked Man".
462	Quintus Teal, a "Graduate Architect" in the Los Angeles area, wants architects to be inspired by topology and the Picard–Vessiot theory. During a conversation with friend Homer Bailey he shows models made of toothpicks and clay, representing projections of a four-dimensional tesseract, the equivalent of a cube, and convinces Bailey to build one. The house is quickly constructed in an "inverted double cross" shape (having eight cubical rooms, arranged as a stack of four cubes with a further four cubes surrounding the second cube up on the stack). The night before Teal is to show Bailey and his wife, Matilda, around the house, an earthquake occurs. The three of them arrive the next morning to find what appears to be just a single cubical room. 
463	In attempting to move from one room to another by way of a French window, Teal falls outside and lands in shrubbery. Exploring further, they find that the windows of the original top room do not connect where they mathematically "should". One gives a dizzying view from above the Empire State Building, another an upside-down view of a seascape. A third window looks out on a place of no-space, with no color, not even black. The fourth window looks out on an unearthly desert scene. Just then another earthquake hits, and so they exit in a panic through the open window. They find themselves in a desert with twisted, tree-like vegetation around them, with no sign of the house or the window they just jumped through. They are relieved when they discover, from a passing truck driver, that they are in Joshua Tree National Park.
464	Frank Nugent of The New York Times said, "Paramount must have been carried away when it finally succeeded in bringing Joe E. Brown and Martha Raye (and their mouths) together in a comedy. Only it wasn't carried far enough away. $1,000 a Touchdown, played at the Criterion yesterday, is a painfully witless football farce of almost fantastic unoriginality. There is even a scene in which Eric Blore turns to Mr. Brown and says, "Now I leave you to Morpheus." (That wasn't a take-em, folks: it was Joe Miller clutching Mr. Brown's shoulder). It ends with Joe E. scoring the last-second touchdown by being thrown over the goal posts. They threw the wrong man: Delmer Daves, who wrote it, would be our choice—and we'd insist on a field goal."
465	At the end of 2007, the biotech company Knome debuted the first direct-to-consumer genome sequencing service at an initial price of $350,000 (including analysis). One of the first clients was Dan Stoicescu, a Swiss-based biotech entrepreneur. As the costs of sequencing continued to plummet, in 2008, Illumina announced that it had sequenced an individual genome for $100,000 in reagent costs. Applied Biosystems countered by saying the cost on its platform was $60,000. Pacific Biosciences became the latest entrant in what The New York Times called "a heated race for the '$1,000 genome'". In 2009, Stanford University professor Stephen Quake published a paper sequencing his own genome on an instrument built by Helicos Biosciences (a company he co-founded) for a reported cost in consumables of $48,000. That same year, Complete Genomics debuted its proprietary whole-genome sequencing service for researchers, charging as little as $5,000/genome for bulk orders.
466	In 2010, Illumina introduced its individual genome sequencing service for consumers, who were required to present a doctor's note. The initial price was $50,000/person. One of the first clients was former Solexa CEO John West, who had his entire family of four sequenced. In January 2012, Life Technologies unveiled a new sequencing instrument, the Ion Proton Sequencer, which it said would achieve the $1,000 genome in a day within 12 months. Sharon Begley wrote: "After years of predictions that the '$1,000 genome' – a read-out of a person's complete genetic information for about the cost of a dental crown—was just around the corner, a U.S. company is announcing... that it has achieved that milestone."
467	In January 2014, Illumina launched its HiSeq X Ten Sequencer, claiming to have produced the first $1,000 genome at 30× coverage. Some researchers hailed the HiSeq X Ten's release as a milestone – Michael Schatz of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said that "it is a major human accomplishment on par with the development of the telescope or the microprocessor". However, critics pointed out that the $10 million upfront investment required to purchase the system would deter customers. Furthermore, the $1,000 genome cost calculation left out overheads, such as the cost of powering the machine. In September 2015, Veritas Genetics (co-founded by George Church) announced $1,000 full-genome sequencing including interpretation for participants in the Personal Genome Project.
468	In April 2017, the newly formed European company Dante Labs started offering the WGS for $900. In 2017, Beijing Genomics Institute began offering WGS for $600. In July 2018, on Amazon Prime Day, Dante Labs offered it for $349. In November 2018, around the time of Black Friday, Dante Labs offered WGS for the first time less than $200, and Veritas Genetics for two days for the same price of $199 offered WGS limited to a thousand customers. In March of the same year, geneticist Matthew Hurles of Wellcome Sanger Institute noted that the private companies, including Illumina, are currently competing to reach a new target for WGS of only $100. In February 2020, Nebula Genomics started offering WGS for $299.
469	It was originally announced that the revamped Archon Genomics X PRIZE presented by Medco would hold a $10-million grand prize competition in January 2013 for the team that reaches (or comes closest to reaching) the $1,000 genome. The grand prize would go to "the team(s) able to sequence 100 human genomes within 30 days to an accuracy of 1 error per 1,000,000 bases, with 98% completeness, identification of insertions, deletions and rearrangements, and a complete haplotype, at an audited total cost of $1,000 per genome." In August 2013 the Archon Genomics X PRIZE was cancelled, as the founders felt it had been "Outpaced by Innovation," and "was not incentivizing the technological changes".
470	UPI called the album "strong," writing that producer Jim Dickinson "worked his magic." The Washington Post wrote that $1.99 Romances "separates the group from the jam-band pack by using Steely Dan as its main model rather than the usual choices of the Grateful Dead or the Allman Brothers." Trouser Press wrote that the band "is like a top-drawer wedding band taking the liberty of showcasing some songs of its own devising while the chopped liver is being served." Billboard praised Dickson's production work, writing that the album "captures the group's Steely Dan-like musical cool and sophistication." Steve Blush, in New York Rock: From the Rise of The Velvet Underground to the Fall of CBGB, called it "a dollar-bin classic."
471	While one of the six who appeared on the game show won the grand prize, his or her two home "partners" would win $500 each. Each of the remaining five on-air contestants would receive at least $1,000, and their partners would receive $100. During the TV show, the six contestants would face a game board with 36 numbered panels. Each panel would reveal a plus or minus dollar amount (scores could never go below zero); players would try to accumulate the most money by randomly selecting panels. There would be special panels such as bankrupt, lose a turn, wipeout, and double. The player who collects the highest prize amount after five rounds was declared the winner and received the $100,000 grand prize.  The other contestants, one at a time, would then be given a choice to keep their total winnings or trade them for a choice of prizes (hidden behind 12 numbered panels). These ranged from cash amounts totaling between $1,000 and $10,000 to merchandise such as rooms of furniture, trips, a big screen television, a camcorder combo, and many others. These rules only lasted the first seven months the show was on the air. Afterwards, the losing contestants got to keep whatever money they earned in the game, with a minimum of $1,500 if they didn't have that much.
472	Baseball historian Bill James rated the 1914 edition of the $100,000 infield the greatest infield of all time, and also ranked the 1912 and 1913 editions in the top five all time. The $100,000 infield helped the Athletics win four American League championships in five years—1910, 1911, 1913 and 1914—and win the World Series in 1910, 1911 and 1913. The group was broken up after losing the 1914 World Series as a result of the financial pressures resulting from the emergence of the Federal League. Two members—Collins and Baker—have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.
473	Collins was the first member of the $100,000 infield to join the Athletics. He debuted on September 17, 1906, after playing college ball at Columbia University. In 1906 and 1907, he played 20 games for the Athletics, mostly at shortstop. In 1908, he took over as the Athletics' regular second baseman, replacing Danny Murphy, who moved to the outfield. During the $100,000 infield years from 1910 to 1914, he played 738 games, getting 922 hits in 2,677 at bats for a batting average of .344. He led the American League in runs in 1912, 1913 and 1914, stolen bases in 1910, singles in 1913 and times on base in 1914. He also finished in the top ten in the American League in batting average, on-base percentage, hits, stolen bases, singles and times on base every year from 1910 through 1914. In addition, he finished in the top ten in American Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, winning the Most Valuable Player award in 1914. He was sold to the Chicago White Sox after the 1914 season as Athletics' manager Connie Mack attempted to respond to the financial pressures brought on by the newly formed Federal League, breaking up the $100,000 infield. He returned to Mack and the Athletics in 1927, finishing his career playing 12 games for the Athletics in their 1929 and 1930 World Championship seasons. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1939.
474	Barry was the next to join the Athletics, debuting on July 13, 1908, after playing for the College of the Holy Cross. Between 1910 and 1914, Barry played 686 games for the Athletics, getting 607 hits in 2,334 at bats for a batting average of .260. He finished in the American League top ten in sacrifice hits every year from 1911 through 1914, and ranked fifth in the American League in runs batted in in 1913. But his primary contributions were on defense, where he had a strong arm, enormous range and sure hands, and was able to work out innovative plays with his good friend Collins, such as a defense against the double steal. He finished in the top 20 in Most Valuable Player voting every year from 1911 through 1914, with his best showing a ninth-place finish in 1913. He was sold to the Boston Red Sox in the middle of the 1915 season, where he moved to second base and played on the Red Sox' 1915 and 1916 World Championship teams. He missed the Red Sox 1918 Championship season due to service in the U.S. Navy.
475	Baker also joined the Athletics in 1908, debuting on September 21. He became the Athletics regular third baseman in 1909, and led the American League in triples that season. Between 1910 and 1914, Baker played 742 games for the Athletics, getting 929 hits in 2,864 at bats for a batting average of .324.

In 1909 and 1910, he played more games backing up Barry at shortstop than at any other position. Before the 1911 season, Mack decided to make McInnis his regular first baseman, replacing the popular veteran Harry Davis, although McInnis did have to begin the season as the Athletics' shortstop when Barry became ill before taking over at first base. Defensively as a first baseman, he was known for having exceptional reach. Between 1910 and 1914, McInnis played 614 games for the Athletics, getting 715 hits in 2,228 at bats for a batting average of .321. He led the American League in singles in 1914, and finished in the top ten in batting average, hits, total bases, runs batted in and singles every year from 1912 through 1914.

483	The arms procurement investigative committee was inaugurated on 31 August 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the procurement of ammunition to fight against insurgency during the administration of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. The interim report of the committee revealed several illicit and fraudulent financial transactions. The report revealed an extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and inexplicable spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. This amount excluded grants received by the state governments and funds received by the Directorate of State Services and the Nigerian Police Force.The committee analyzed how funds were transferred to the office of the National Security Adviser and the Nigerian Armed Forces in local and foreign currencies.The committee observed that about $2.2 billion was disbursed for the procurement of ammunition to tackle insurgency but regretted that despite this enormous financial transactions, little or nothing was spent for the procurement of the arms for which the fund was disbursed.The committee discovered that out of the 513 contracts awarded at $8,356,525,184.32, ₦2,189,265,724,404.55 and £54,000.00, about 53 were failed contracts amounting to about  $2,378,939,066.27 and ₦13,729,342,329.87 respectively.The committee also noted that the amount of foreign currencies spent on failed contracts was more than twice the $1 billion loan approved by the National Assembly for borrowing from the World bank to fight insurgency.The investigative committee also discovered a total transfer of ₦3.850 billion to a single company by Colonel Dansuki, the former National Security Adviser. These transactions were made with neither agreements nor fulfilment of tax obligations to the Federal Government of Nigeria.

485	On 17 November 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of Colonel Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser, on alleged siphoning of the arms procurement funds. Dasuki claimed that ordering his arrest by the President is illegal.  He denied that he was invited by the investigation committee on issues related to arms procurement.According to Premium Times, Dansuki said "I have never been invited formally or informally to appear before the panel. I am therefore not only surprised but embarrassed by the seeming indictment by the panel purportedly operating from the office of the National Security Adviser that never contacted me".Prior to ordering his arrest by the president for siphoning the arms procurement fund, on 19 July 2015, the operative of the Department of State Security Service stormed his residence at Abuja and confiscated his international passport. He was charged with unlawful possession of firearms and foreign currencies.

Despite this ruling, the DSS prevented him from traveling abroad by putting him under a house arrest insisting that Dasuki have some questions to answer on the $2 billion arms procurement deal.On 18 November 2015, a US-based newspaper, The Washington Times, in a report entitled "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Dupes the US", criticized President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki house under siege and for declining the order of the court permitting Dasuki to travel for medical attention.  The newspaper described Buhari's action as an attempt to destroy his political opponents like Dasuki with tyrannical methods.In the same vein, Alhaji Tanko Yakasai, a former Liaison Officer to President Shehu Shagari and a founding member of the  Arewa Consultative Forum, and Frederick Fasehun, a leader of the Oodua Peoples Congress, berated President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki's house under siege and for disobeying the court order.  Both leaders described Buhari's action as "deliberate neglect of the rule of law or re-introduction of subtle autocracy in the leadership of the country". They described Buhari's anti-corruption war as "selective"Yakassai said, "Since President Buhari and the Attorney General have decided to disobey the court order which says that Col. Sambo Dasuki be allowed to travel abroad for medical attention, it means that Buhari is all out on a revenge mission."Fredrick Fasheun said, "Where a court order has been given and the President flouts the court order, how can you claim change in the democracy, except change from democracy to autocracy, as we are seeing now."
487	On 1 December 2015, Colonel Dasuki was arrested by the Department of State Security Services and transferred to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission for further interrogation.Prior to Dasuki's arrest, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested by the Department of the State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order which led to Dasuki's arrest. After Dasuki was transferred to the EFCC, he initially decided not to comment on the issue or write any statement, claiming that he had been subjected to media trial.The EFCC operatives then issued Dasuki a copy of the statement made by Shaibu Salisu, a statement that seemed rather implicating. Dasuki was shocked by Salisu's confessional statement. According to The Nation, Colonel Dasuki said, "You mean Salisu wrote all these! You mean he said these! Give me a pen and paper." Dasuki gave a long list of people involved in the deal.He mentioned Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.
488	On 1 December 2015, Chief Raymond Dopesi, the Chair Emeritus of Daar Communication PLC, was arrested at his residence in Abuja by the EFCC in connections with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki.Preliminary evidence showed that Chief Dopesi received ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent reasons for the financial transaction. Chief Dopesi, said the ₦2.1 billion received from the Office of the National Security Adviser was payment for media and political campaign for the re-election of President Goodluck Jonathan.On Tuesday, 8 December 2015, Chief Dokpesi was arraigned by the Federal Government of Nigeria before a federal high court sitting in Abuja on six count charges of money laundering and other financial crimes.The prosecutor maintained that the transfer of a total sum of ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser breaches section 58 (4) (b) of the Public Procurement Act 2007 and punishable under Section 58 (6) and (7) of the same Act, as well as under Section 17 (b) of the EFCC Act, 2004.
489	On 14 December 2015, Justice Gabriel Kolawole ruled that Chief Dokpesi should be granted a bail in the sum of ₦400 million with two surety in like sum.

He was arrested alongside Chief Raymond Dokpesi, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa and his son.Preliminary evidence showed that Ambassador Yuguda received ₦1.5 billion from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent basis for the financial transaction. The money was transferred into his account through an unknown company for inexplicable purpose. According to Premium Times, "The funds were directly transferred to him from the NSA office and he has been unable to explain the rationale for the transfer. The transfers were made to his account between December 2014 and May 2015".Additional ₦1.275 billion was also transferred to his account during the campaign for the 2015 Nigerian general electionAlso ₦775 million was transferred into his account from the office of the Accountant General of the Federation.On 30 November 2015, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested in connection with the arms procurement deal. Investigation reveal that Salisu operates a joint account with Sambo Dasuki. According to Thisday, EFCC operatives said "We just discovered a huge sum of money in foreign currencies in a joint account – being operated by the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki and a director in his office, one Shauibu Salisu. He is also being interrogated by EFCC operatives." Salisu's confessional statements led to Dasuki's arrest.
491	Investigation also revealed a payment of ₦650 million into the account Nduka Obaigbena, owner of Arise TV and Thisday publisher. He denied receiving any money from the Office of the National Security Adviser.On 12 December 2015, the management of Thisday denied receiving money related to arms procurement from the former National Security Adviser. The management in its response to an invitation letter from the EFCC dated 8 November 2015, received in its Abuja office on 8 December 2015, said all funds received from the Office of the National Security Adviser , "are payments for compensation to mitigate the dastardly Boko Haram twin bombings of the ThisDay Newspapers offices in Abuja and Kaduna on Thursday April 26, 2012".
492	On Thursday 3 December 2015, Saliu Atawodi, an Air vice-marshal (rtd) and Chairman of the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety, was arrested by EFCC on alleged involvement in the arms procurement deal. He was accused of illegal diversion of ₦600 million meant for the procurement of military boats for use in fighting against insurgency. However, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Tuesday 6 June 2017, discharged and acquitted Atawodi. In a judgement delivered by Justice Tani Hassan-Yusuf, the Court dismissed the judgment of an Abuja High Court which earlier asked Atawodi to open his defense.
493	Supposed several pieces of unsubstantiated evidence allegedly established the fact that about $2 billions was transferred into the Office of the National Security Adviser.Premium Times published a letter sent to Goodluck Jonathan by Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala requesting the former President's approval of a transfer of about $300 million (£5.5 million) from money recovered from  the late General Sani Abacha to the office of the National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a few days before the presidential election held in April 2015.The letter, dated 20 January 2015, was addressed to the former president following the 12 January 2015 request for funds by the office of the National Security Adviser under the leadership of Dasuki for the procurement of arms and intelligence equipment.
494	Please find a request by the National Security Adviser (NSA) for the transfer of $300 million and £5.5 million of the recovered Abacha funds to an ONSA (Office of the National Security Adviser) operations account. The NSA has explained that this is to enable the purchase of ammunition, security, and other intelligence equipment for the security agencies in order to enable them fully confront the ongoing Boko Haram threat. His request is sequel to the meeting you chaired with the committee on the use of recovered funds where the decision was made that recovered Abacha funds would be split 50-50 between urgent security needs to confront Boko Haram and development need (including a portion for the Future Generations window of the Sovereign Wealth Fund). This letter is to seek your approval to borrow these funds, for now, to disburse to the NSA. These funds form part of the projected Federal Government Independent Revenue, to be appropriated, in the light and for accountability, given the peculiar nature of security and intelligence transactions, we would expect the NSA to account to Your Excellency for the utilisation of the funds.
495	 “I could remember on the 20/11/2014, I was directed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki to go to the CBN and collect the sum of $47m in cash and the balance in Euro and the directive was obeyed and the monies were delivered to the NSA in about 11 suit cases. I acknowledged the receipt of the money from the CBN which was handed over to M.S. Dasuki. I did not benefit even one cent. The request for the funds was tag(sic) Special Services signed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki, addressed to the Governor of CBN.I did not know the source of the money into our CBN Account. The foreign currencies that I collected from the CBN were delivered to the NSA in his house, No. 13, John Kadiya Street, Asokoro."
496	Ambassador Yuguda claimed to have delivered a sum of N600 million to six chairmen of the National Working Committee, the Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the People's Democratic Party for the 2015 general election. According to him, the beneficiaries includes  Yerima Abdullahi, Chief Bode George, Peter Odili, Jim Nwobodo,  Attahiru Bafarawa and Ahmadu Ali.He transferred  N300 million to BAM Properties, whose account details were sent to him by Bello Haliru, a former National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. He also claimed to have sent N200 million to Bello Sarkin Yaki, the Governorship aspirant in Kebbi State. According to him, Mahmud Shinkafi, the former Governor of Zamfara State, received  ₦100 million.
497	For the cash disbursement of  ₦600million, it was meant for the six zonal chairmen for Contact and Mobilisation Committees for Election of 2015. The chairmen are Bode George, Amb. Yerima Abdullahi; Peter Odili; Attahiru Bafarawa; Jim Nwobodo; Ahmadu  Ali. The sum of  ₦100million was given to each chairman. I gave the money in company of Prof. Alkali, who was Political Adviser to former president. The zonal chairmen are for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). I also instructed Jabbama Limited to transfer the sum of N100m to Dalhatu Limited on the request of Attahiru Bafarawa. I also remember that Bello Sarkin Yaki was among the people that the then NSA instructed that I send the sum of N200million to. He was the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kebbi State. I knew the chairman of Stallion Limited whose second name I cannot remember. Between December 2014 to June 2015, on the instruction of the then NSA, I introduced Jabbama Limited to a staff of the company on the instruction of the chairman. When the account was in credit, disbursement was made from time to time on the instruction of the then NSA. Part in foreign exchange or transfers. I wish to add that sometime in February 2015, I instructed Jabbama to transfer the sum of N300m to BAM Properties. The account was given to me by Bello Haliru as one of the people the former NSA requested me to give money. I also remember that Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi was sent the sum of N100million on the instruction of the then NSA. Further to my statement of 30th November, 2015, I have brought the sum of $829,800(equivalent to N200m) and N600m was given to me to distribute to the six PDP Zonal Committee chairmen. I don’t know who are the directors of Dalhatu Investment Limited but funds were transferred to the company’s account on the instruction of Dalhatu Bafarawa for the total amount of N1.5billion received from the then NSA by Jabbama Limited. I shall endeavour to recover the sum of N600million given to the six zonal PDP committee chairmen, while I appeal to the commission to use their machineries to trace the remaining balance of the money transferred to various accounts
498	“My attention has been drawn to another mischievous and deliberately fraudulent claim that I collected N100 million from Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. This is another blatant falsehood, stripped of any iota of truth. This is yet again a depraved continuation of lynch mob journalism orchestrated by an online newspaper. The salient fact is that very early this year, long before the election period, the party set up Contact and Mobilization Committee for each zone to reconcile various factions and ensure a firm unity of purpose within the zones before the election. I was elected as the Chairman for the South-West zone. The committee which was made up of 18 senior members of the party with distinguished history of honour and exemplary leadership, met at least 10 times in my office in Lagos. These people travelled all the way from every corner of the South-West, with three members representing each state. All of them are very much alive to testify to my assertions. Sometime in the middle of these deliberations, Yuguda came to me and said the party was reimbursing the 18 elders of the committee for their transportation, accommodation and feeding allowance for the work that was done. The committee later submitted the report of its deliberations to the party and then wound up. For all these efforts Yuguda gave the committee only $30,000. That was less than N6 million at that time. Yuguda can never claim that he gave the Committee N100 million. That is the figment of the imagination of rascally scribblers purporting to be journalists. Again, facts are sacred.”
499	Initially, Ray only used item prices against her $40 limit. She started including applicable taxes and tips during the first season. On occasion, she does go over budget; however, during her trips to Philadelphia and Arizona, she did so on purpose. Her cheapest day was in Vancouver, British Columbia, in 2003, when she spent just under $25 USD including taxes and tips (at the time, less than $40 Canadian, although she budgeted for $40 USD). On occasions, she has had to get creative to stay on-budget; for example, she accidentally blew half her budget on her second meal in her first Miami episode.
500	The pilot, shot in Los Angeles, had a 12-hour limit, but subsequent episodes raised it to 24 hours. Usually episodes begin in the morning with breakfast, occasionally brunch. Episodes almost always feature four paid meals, but on at least one occasion, in the Research Triangle (Raleigh-Durham-Chapel Hill, NC), she did five meals. Also on rare occasion, only three meals are paid, and a fourth ends up being free. On only one occasion, in Antigua, she partook of a hotel's free Continental breakfast, but she still did four paid meals in that episode.
501	The film begins with a screen that says, "In Montana, things often happen with a surprising suddenness." This is followed by a black screen with the words, "Help!" appearing multiple times. What appears to be a brawl including guns is unfolding across the street where a business owner notices and calls for help. Then, we see a black screen that says, "Get him boys, don't let him get away." Then there is some more brawling, followed by a black screen that says, "I've got what you're after, try and get it." Some more brawling, followed by a screen that says, "50,000 reward to the man who gets him." The men start running after Tex Sherwood as it appears, and he runs away on his horse. The group of men all hop on their horses and follow Ken until they see he has gone up a hill with his horse and the rest of them can't seem to get up there. A black screen then appears and it says, "Tex Sherwood cowpuncher from the Rio Grande, the cause of all the excitement, who has come to Montana to transact some business of a personal nature," Then, we see a black screen that says, "Buck Scofield, the leader of a lawless outfit," and "Tarzan, Tex Sherwood's pal, by himself." Here, we can tell that Tarzan is Ted Sherwood's horse. Then we see Ted and a black screen that says, "We fooled 'em boy, didn't we?" Tarzan nods, and Sherwood rides him down onto the other side of the hill.
502	The scenes change, and we are now in an office. A black screen says, "Asa Holman, president of the bank, and a big man in local affairs." We see this character who appears to be Asa Holman speaking and a black screen that says, "Tex Sherwood is in town with the papers. I've offered Buck and his gang $50,000 reward to get those documents." We then see a man reply, he is Eli Higgins, Holman's lawyer. Holman and Higgins exchange back and forth. Holman looks concerned, saying "I have millions at stake. If he records those papers, I am ruined."
503	$50SAT was developed by Bob Twiggs at Morehead State University (MSU) along with three other radio amateurs and was used to train students. The satellite transmits telemetry data in various operating modes in the 70 cm band. It is based on the PocketQube design for very small and inexpensive satellites and measures 5 cm × 5 cm × 7.5 cm (1.5 U). After several months of problems due to low battery voltage, $50SAT finally dropped below the 3,300 mV required for data transmission on July 19, 2015 and thus ceased operation.

506	Ed is a very opinionated 72-year-old who has been divorced three times. His two adult sons, Henry and Vince, are accustomed to his unsolicited and often politically incorrect rants. When Henry, a struggling writer and blogger, can no longer afford his rent, he is forced to move back in with Ed, which creates new problems in their tricky father–son relationship. As weeks go by Henry is unable to find a job as a writer, mostly due to the lack of good material. He finally lands a job,  when during his interview Ed interrupts with an irrational phone call that sparks the interest of the eccentric editor conducting the interview. Henry is ultimately hired, but is forced to continue living with Ed in order to have readily available material via his father's unsolicited rants, hence the title $#*! My Dad Says.

510	Marge spends all her time at the casino and neglects her family. She fails to notice when Maggie crawls away from the slots and is nearly mauled by a white tiger from Gunter and Ernst's circus act. She forgets to help Lisa make a costume for her geography pageant, forcing her to wear one poorly designed by her father, which consists of Homer taping her between two foam mattresses with "Florida" misspelled as "Floreda" on the front piece. Homer bursts into the casino searching for Marge. Security cameras capture his rampage, causing Burns to demote him to his old job at the power plant. After realizing how much he misses the plant, Burns decides to return to it. When Homer confronts Marge with her behavior, she realizes that she has a gambling problem. 
511	The episode was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, and directed by Wes Archer. The story of the episode originated from a newspaper article that Oakley and Weinstein found about a town in Mississippi that was introducing riverboat gambling. Oakley said another inspiration for it was that there had not been many episodes about Springfield as a whole and how "crummy" the town was, so they filled the whole first act with scenes showing how "crummy" and "dismal" Springfield was. Oakley particularly liked the animation of the lights inside the casino on the slot machines and the lamps in the ceiling. The "way they radiate out" had always amazed him. Archer, who directed the animation of the episode, also thought they turned out well. The lights were especially hard for them to animate back then because the show was animated traditionally on cels, so Archer was pleased with the results. A deleted scene from the episode shows Homer dealing cards to James Bond. The staff liked the scene, so they decided to put it in the clip show episode "The Simpsons 138th Episode Spectacular".
512	There was a brief period when the episode had a different subplot that revolved around the restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening had been told by a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.Instead, Gerry Cooney and Robert Goulet guest starred as themselves. Executive producer David Mirkin enjoyed directing Goulet because he was "such a good sport" and had "a great sense of humor". Oakley thought it was nice that Goulet was willing to make fun of himself in the episode, which at the time was rare for guest stars on The Simpsons. This episode features the first appearances of Gunter and Ernst, the Siegfried and Roy-esque casino magicians who are attacked by their white tiger, Anastasia. Ten years after this episode first aired, Roy Horn was attacked by one of the duo's white tigers. The Simpsons production team dismissed the novelty of the prediction by saying that it was "bound to happen" sooner or later. The Rich Texan also makes his debut appearance in this episode, referred to as "Senator" by Homer.
513	The title is a reference to the 1964 film Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, the music of which was composed by Laurie Johnson. Two of his songs, Happy-go-lively and Rue de la park can be heard within the News on Parade segment at the beginning of the episode. Burns' bed looks similar to the one occupied by Keir Dullea's character Dave Bowman in the end of the 1968 film, 2001: A Space Odyssey. Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise appear at the casino to reprise their roles from the 1988 film Rain Man. Homer is impressed by the card-counting abilities of a man who resembles Raymond Babbitt, Hoffman's character in the film. Krusty's show at midnight is similar to Bill Cosby's 1971 album For Adults Only, which was recorded at a casino at midnight. Marge reminds Homer that his lifelong dream was to be a contestant on the television show The Gong Show.
514	Burns's paranoid obsession with germs and cleanliness, and his refusal to leave his bedroom once the casino opens, parodies American magnate Howard Hughes, who had obsessive-compulsive disorder, and was involved in the casino business in his later years. The "Spruce Moose", an absurdly tiny wooden plane Burns makes in the episode, is a parody of Hughes' impractically enormous wooden plane, derisively nicknamed the "Spruce Goose". Homer parodies the scene in the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz when the Scarecrow demonstrates his newly acquired intelligence by (incorrectly) reciting the law that governs the lengths of the sides of an isosceles triangle. Unlike in the film, somebody correctly points out that the Pythagorean theorem recited applies only to right triangles, not isosceles triangles.
515	Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented that "this excellent episode includes a surprising number of concurrent plots. Homer also works in the casino and tries to care for the family without Marge. It balances them deftly and provides great laughs along the way." Adam Suraf of Dunkirkma.net named it the third best episode of the season. He also praised the episode's cultural references. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: "There's a lovely nod to the earlier episodes in which Marge protests the citizenry's hare-brained ideas at council meetings. A series of bizarre moments rather than a story—we're especially fond of Homer's photographic memory and Mr Burns' descent into insanity—but great fun." Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a grade of A, and Bill Gibron of DVD Talk gave it a score of 4 out of 5. The episode is Sarah Culp of The Quindecim's eleventh-favorite episode of the show, and one of Les Winan of Box Office Prophets's favorite episodes. A scene from the episode where former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger meets Burns was included in the 2002 documentary film The Trials of Henry Kissinger.
516	&&&&& received critical acclaim from music critics. Tiny Mix Tapes says the mixtape "has the potential to conjure an emotional frenzy that’s alluring to the senses in a way that so much electronic artistry fails to even approach." No Ripcord praised the mixtape for "its density, its intensity, its I'm-lost-in-a-big-city feel, its warm gust of beats blowing while the subway comes squeaking into the station, its darkness, its late-night ecstasy, its rawness, its rawness like raw milk, like drinking raw milk or eating sushi in an inexpensive restaurant somewhere on a street with trash and tweakers, its little motifs that twinkle like stars or Christmas lights, its muscular compactness." In a review of the reissue, Pitchfork said that "there’s something a bit melancholy about listening to &&&&& now—the feeling that instead of freeing us from the past, technology has left us stuck in a loop, endlessly refreshing in search of a better world that never arrives, but that we can still dream of in our art."
517	On December 14, 2017 Davichi were reported to be returning with a full-length album in January 2018. According to reports, Davichi were busy preparing for their year-end concert 'La eve - Davichi Concert' and also recording tracks of the album when they had time. On December 21, it was reported that Kang Daniel of boygroup Wanna One would star in Davichi's upcoming comeback music video. This would be his second time acting in an MV following Wanna One's "Beautiful". On January 16, 2018 B2M Entertainment confirmed that Davichi's third studio album would be released on January 25.
518	In a statement made by Eilish to The Fader through email, she wrote, "Vince Staples was my number 1 choice, so when we got him to hear it and he agreed to do it, it was incredible and the verse he did is so good. He is a god and I'm excited for it to finally come out!" When Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell were recording the song, it was under the title of "Watch & Burn". The track later became two separate songs, with one being "Watch" (2017), and the other being "&Burn".
519	Critical commentary described "&Burn" as a hip hop-influenced pop track. David Renshaw from The Fader described "&Burn" as a "moody slow-burner packed with booming drums and hushed verses". Wandera Hussein of Billboard stated  the track is supported by "booming kick drums" and "velvety keys". She further mentioned that Eilish's vocals are "poignant, baby-soft, [and] express a fiery revenge". Staples provides background vocals on the song and his appearance has been described as a "deep and gloomy verse". The song starts with the strike of a match, which continues throughout as the main beat.
520	"&Burn" was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. Insider's Callie Ahlgrim commented that "Watch" feels more "vulnerable" and "nostalgic", while "&Burn" sounds "powerful" and "resolute". Lindsay Howard of Variance labeled the former as "simmering". Robin Murray of Clash described "&Burn" as a "remarkable fusion that brings out the best in [Eilish] and [Staples]. Matthew Kent, writing for The Line of Best Fit, depicted the song as one of "Eilish's best tracks to date" and saw it as "a darker duet more akin to the track's lyrics about literally setting an ex's car on fire". The staff of NME explained that "the end product sees the pair feed off of each other's bolshy attitude as they trade verses in this hard-hitting reimagining of 'Watch', a restrained moment from 'Don't Smile at Me'". Nicole Almeida of Atwood Magazine dubbed the song as "stronger" and "bolder" than "Watch", but still "retain[s] the same vulnerability the original lyrics offer". Commercially, "&Burn" has been certified gold in the United States and Australia by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), respectively. To promote "&Burn", Eilish performed it live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival with Staples in April 2019.
521	&ME tells the story of Eduard (Mark Waschke), a gay and disillusioned bureaucrat, who leaves Berlin for Brussels to take up a post within the European Parliament. There he meets the beautiful and idealistic young lawyer Edurne (Verónica Echegui), from Spain, who has finally escaped the clutches of her over-protective mother (Rossy de Palma). Edurne falls madly for Eduard, a handsome, sophisticated man that she can show off to the world. Eduard is happy to go along with the situation, surprised at the level of affection he feels for this young woman. He might even call it love, because love - c'est bizarre.
522	&Now is traveling biennial literary festival and a publishing organization, both focused on innovative literature. The festival's main emphasis is on work that blends or crosses genres and includes a wide variety of work, such as multimedia projects, performance pieces, criti-fictional presentations, and otherwise. The festival seeks out "literary art as it is practiced today by authors who consciously treat their work as a process that is aware of its own literary and extra-literary history, that is as much about its form and materials, language, communities, and practice as it is about its subject matter." Most of the work presented by authors is considered experimental literature.
523	& is an extended play by Japanese recording artist and songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released on 9 July 2003, by record label Avex Trax. Hamasaki's fourth extended play, & consists of four recordings; "Ourselves", "Greatful Days", "Hanabi: Episode II", and "Theme of A-Nation 03", with three additional instrumentals of the first three tracks. It was released in two different formats; a stand-alone CD, and a digital EP. The artwork for the EP depicts Hamasaki posing in front of a cloudy backdrop, with the title of the work superimposed over her hair. & contains predominantly J-pop and dance music.
524	Hamasaki contributed by writing the lyrics to all the tracks, while Japanese production and manager Max Matsuura served as the EP's main producer. & received favourable reviews from music critics who commended the EP's production and commercial appeal. & reached number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 500,000 units. "Ourselves", "Greatful Days", "Hanabi: Episode II", and "Theme of A-Nation 03" served as promotional singles, while all but the latter track receiving music videos respectively. & was awarded the Japan Record Award at the 46th Japan Record Awards for Best Pop/Rock Album.
525	Ayumi Hamasaki announced that she would release a new extended play, marketed as a single, entitled &. It consists of four recordings – "Ourselves", "Greatful Days", "Hanabi: Episode II", and "Theme of A-Nation 03" – with additional instrumental versions of the first three tracks. & was released on 9 July 2003 as the first single from Hamasaki's 2003 extended play, Memorial Address. ("Ourselves", "Greatful Days", and "Hanabi: Episode II" were included in Memorial Address.) & follows the releases of Hamasaki's previous extended plays; Nothing from Nothing (1995), A (1999), and H (2002). Hamasaki did not release another extended-play single until Five in 2011. & was released in two formats: a stand-alone CD and a digital EP. The artwork for the EP depicts Hamasaki posing in front of a cloudy backdrop, with the title of the work superimposed over her hair.
526	& opens with the first track, "Ourselves", which is an R&B tune with influences of "exoticism pop". The lyrics describe Hamasaki's "painful" sense of sorrow and love. "Greatful Days" is a "refreshing" pop song that showcases Hamasaki's "festive" nature, her "pastel" vocals, and a "relaxing" positive message of happiness. "Hanabi: Episode II" is an answer song to Hamasaki's 2002 song, "Hanabi". It describes Hamasaki's "miserable" state and "struggle[s]" that is transformed into strength. "Theme of A-Nation 03" was used for the Avex A-Nation concert tour in 2003, and emphasizes traditional Japanese instrumentals, progressing more oriental J-pop sounds. The next three tracks are instrumental versions of "Ourselves", "Greatful Days", and "Hanabi: Episode II".
527	"Ourselves", "Greatful Days", and "Hanabi: Episode II" all served as the EP's promotional singles, released on 9 July 2003; the singles did not chart in any Japanese music charts. The singles were promoted through different endorsements deals in Japan; "Ourselves" was used as the televised theme song for Japanese cosmetics brand, Visee, and "Greatful Days" was used as the theme song for Hamasaki's 2004 TV series, Ayuready?. However, by the time the promotion of &, Memorial Address, and her 2003–2004 arena tour was complete, Hamasaki had grown dissatisfied with her position in Avex; she felt that the company was treating her as a product instead of a person. Although Hamasaki initially supported the exploitation of her popularity for commercial purposes, saying that it was "necessary that [she is] viewed as a product", she eventually opposed Avex's decision to market her as a "product rather than a person". All three songs featured an accompanying music video, which were included on several DVD compilations by Hamasaki.
528	& received favourable reviews from music critics. A reviewer from CD Journal commended the EP's production, and highlighted all the singles as stand out tracks; the reviewer highlighted its "music quality" as a positive note. Kondo Yang from Listen Japan was positive in his review, stating that & was a sign of growing "maturity" in Hamasaki's music. He also felt that her "charisma" and "personality" was a reason why & became successful. Eri Kato from Hot Express was positive in her review, commending Hamasaki's songwriting and composing skills, particularly with "Hanabi: Episode II", and the music arrangements. She later praised them as "unique masterpieces" and  Alexey Eremenko, who wrote the biography for Hamasaki on AllMusic, highlighted "Ourselves" and "Greatful Days" as one of the stand-out tracks of the extended play and Hamasaki's long career.
529	On the Japanese Oricon Singles Chart, & reached number one on its debut week, her third consecutive EP to have reached number one, and her sixteenth number one single overall. The EP lasted sixteen weeks in the top 100, selling 680,000 units, and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of 600,000 units. & is Hamasaki's final single to sell over 600,000 units, and her only post-single to achieve a close achievement of the limit is "No Way to Say" with 400,000 physical and digital sales.
530	At the first production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the audience welcomes Shakespeare to the stage ("Larger than Life"). He introduces his wife, Anne Hathaway, who is visiting from Stratford-Upon-Avon to see the play, and explains the plot and ending of the show to her. She suggests he change the ending, wondering what would have happened if Juliet did not kill herself; Shakespeare protests ("I Want It That Way"). He lets her explain her idea for the play, which commences with Juliet waking up to find Romeo dead ("...Baby One More Time").
531	Anne discovers that Juliet is still in love with Romeo and recounts her own romance with Shakespeare ("That's the Way It Is"). At the wedding, Shakespeare, May, Francois, Lance and Romeo perform ("Everybody (Backstreet's Back)"). Juliet walks down the aisle as Francois sings "As Long as You Love Me" as his vows, but they both object to the marriage, with Francois singing "It's Gonna Be Me" to May. Romeo confesses his love to Juliet while her parents insist she returns to Verona with them, stating that they know what's best for her, which Juliet refutes ("Stronger").
532	Reviews of & Then Boom upon release were mixed. As of March 2015, the album holds an aggregated score of a 42 out of 100, indicating "mixed or average reviews", based on six sources. Allmusic journalist Anthony Tognazzini described & Then Boom as "fizzy, fun retro-glam-electro-pop from beginning to end", also noting the variety of the sounds on the record. There were three-star reviews from the Hot Press and Q, with the former's Edwin McFee calling it a "guilty pleasure" and latter calling it a "kitchen-sink hybrid" that "works remarkably well". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian gave the album a similar score, praising it as "crisp electro-rock with a big hook in every tune, and lyrics that present them as a bunch of civic-minded young fellows."
533	However, in more varied reviews, The Guardian's sister paper The Observer, Craig McLean opined that "On the one hand, it's riotously good fun; on the other, it's a bit naff." Shaun Newport, writing for musicOMH, called it a "frustration and disappointment" to listen to, saying that the group "sound nice, look nice but you’d be pressed to find any substance." However, he did give them credit for "absolutely signif[ying] the beginning of the end of our love affair with the ’80s. It was cool, then it was pop and now it has shamelessly gone too far. Thank goodness we always have time to learn from our mistakes." Entertainment.ie's Lauren Murphy called most of the rapping "cringeworthy", with her overall verdict of the album describing it as "two different, disjointed and discordant bands - neither with any direction, and both offering only minimal splashes of fun."
534	There were extremely negative reviews that questioned if BBC Radio 1's promotion of Iglu & Hartly was a joke, as well as criticized the record's cheap and unprofessional-sounding production and songwriting. It got a zero-out-of-ten review from David Renshaw of Drowned in Sound, calling it "the worst album of [2008]." Racheal Crowther, a critic for DIY, rated it a one out of ten, writing that the tracks were "so similar it feels like listening to one really long song rather than an album." In a two-out-of-ten review from NME, Rick Martin called it "an abomination of a debut album, informed by all the most disgusting musical faux pas of the past 20 years." Jarvis Anderson responded to this negative critical reception in an interview; "Reviews are interesting, I'll take negative criticism if someone explains why. We laugh hard at some of them – we take it with a light heart. I certainly haven't really read a negative review that's changed my mind about anything. If anyone's got an opinion maybe I'll use it if it's good, I'm not that stubborn."

536	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" is a song recorded by American rapper Jay-Z featuring his then-girlfriend, American singer Beyoncé Knowles. It was composed by Shawn Carter, Kanye West, Prince Nelson, Tupac Shakur, Darryl Harper, Ricky Rouse and Tyrone Wrice for Jay-Z's seventh studio album The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse (2002). The song was released as the album's lead single on October 10, 2002. A R&B song, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" sampled its beat from American rapper Tupac Shakur's 1996 song "Me and My Girlfriend", paraphrasing its chorus, and was inspired by the crime film Bonnie and Clyde. The instrumentation is based on programmed drums, bass instruments, and a flamenco guitar.
537	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was generally received with favorable reviews by music critics, who complimented the combination of Jay-Z's and Beyoncé's musical styles, their collaboration and the song's production. The single reached number four on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Jay-Z's second top ten single and Beyoncé's first as a solo artist. It charted at number two in the United Kingdom and peaked in the top twenty in other European territories. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA).
538	The accompanying music video was directed by Chris Robinson, and features Jay-Z and Beyoncé playing a modern-day version of the 1920s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. It was nominated for Best Hip-Hop Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" spawned a feud with American recording artist Toni Braxton, who had also sampled "Me and My Girlfriend" in her 2002 song "Me & My Boyfriend". She accused West and Jay-Z of stealing the idea of using the song as a sample, which was later denied by both of them. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was performed by Jay-Z and Beyoncé on several television shows and was later included on the set list of their concert performances and tours, most notably on their co-headlining On the Run and On the Run II tours.
539	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was released on October 10, 2002, as the lead single from Jay-Z's album The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse. Knowles later included the song as a bonus track on international editions of her 2003 debut solo album Dangerously in Love. In 2003, Now That's What I Call Music! included "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" as the opening track of the 12th volume of the US release and the fifteenth track of the 54th volume of the UK release. The song's release was the first indication of Jay-Z's and Knowles’ romantic status, spawning rumors about a burgeoning relationship. Their relationship was not made public until Jay-Z featured on Knowles’ songs "Crazy In Love" (2003) and "Déjà Vu" (2006). The latter's release also marked the debut of the solo career of Knowles, leaving Destiny's Child on hiatus.
540	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" features drums and live instrumentation such as bass instruments and guitar chords. It also consists of a beat sampled from "Me and My Girlfriend". The song was inspired by the 1967 American crime film Bonnie and Clyde as Jay-Z and Beyoncé proclaim themselves as the current version of the criminal duo. Ethan Brown of New York magazine noted that its patina of flamenco guitar was reminiscent of that in Jay-Z's 2001 collaboration with R. Kelly on "Fiesta." Beyoncé mimics the hook of "Me and My Girlfriend" on the chorus as she sings, "Down to ride to the very end, me and my boyfriend".
541	Some lyrics sung by Beyoncé were sampled from "If I Was Your Girlfriend" by American recording artist Prince. On the second verse, Jay-Z references the relationship between Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston, and the American television comedy-drama series Sex and the City as he raps: "She riiides wit' me / The new Bobby and Whitney / Only time we don't speak is during 'Sex and the City' / Put us together, how they gon' stop both of us? / When I'm off track, Mommy is keeping us focused". The verse then continues: "Let's lock this down like it's supposed to be/ The new '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov and B".
542	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was received favorably by critics, who commended the use of different samples, and commented on the relationship between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. Chris Ryan of Spin magazine described "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" as a highlight on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse, stating that it consists of "a house party in a crib as big as the Georgia Dome." John Bush from AllMusic included the song as a highlight on the album, further describing it as "a slick R&B crossover with Beyoncé Knowles". Marc L. Hill of PopMatters viewed it as the "obligatory radio song" of the album. Awarding the song a rating of eight out of ten possible points, Dele Fadele of NME complimented it as "a cool duet" between Jay-Z and Beyoncé. John Robinson of the same publication wrote that as the couple describe their life, it's not all "Lexus and sipping Cris". He added, "A similarly relaxed production makes for a behind-the-diamante-net-curtains classic".
543	Ethan Brown of New York magazine named "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" as a follow-up to the previous "Bonnie & Clyde Part II" by Jay-Z featuring rapper Foxy Brown. Erik Parker, music editor of Vibe magazine, was divided on the song's sample, writing that it was "tasteless but well-executed", and complimented West's production as "impeccable". Margena A. Christian of Jet magazine praised Jay-Z's and Beyoncé's collaboration, favoring the former's "dropping lyrics" and the latter's "cooing silky vocals". Chuck Taylor of Billboard magazine wrote that though it was unclear at the time whether the couple were together or not, but they created good music together. Taylor praised the song's ability to showcase what each artist does best: Jay-Z "spitting" verses of praise, and Beyoncé's sweets coos and hooks. Taylor noted that the sampled acoustic guitar "added spice to the track, setting it up for future success". In a more negative review, Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club described the song as "terrible" and different from the other songs on The Blueprint 2: The Gift & The Curse.
544	Rap-Up credited "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" for giving Beyoncé a "little street-credit". The staff members of Vibe magazine placed the song at number two on a list of the best Bonnie and Clyde inspired songs. On a list of the 10 Best Jay-Z Songs, Dean Silfenv of AOL placed "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" at number six. Popjustice listed "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" at number 66 on its list of the best singles of 2003. It was nominated for the Best Collaboration at the 2003 BET Awards, but lost to Snoop Dogg's song "Beautiful". In a 2013 list of Jay-Z's 20 Biggest Billboard Hits, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was ranked at number 6. Elijah Watson and Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine noted that the song proved the couple was "unstoppable from jump".
545	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" reached the top ten on music charts in six European countries. It peaked at number six on the Norway Singles Chart and on the Danish Singles Chart, number eight on the Italian Singles Chart, and topped the Swiss Singles Charts. In Canada, the song peaked at number four and became Jay-Z's highest charting single until it was surpassed by his 2009 Alicia Keys-assisted song "Empire State of Mind", which peaked at number three. In the United Kingdom, "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. At the time, it became his highest charting single in Britain since "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)" achieved the same feat in November 1998. It peaked at number four on the New Zealand Singles Chart, becoming his highest charting single in that territory. The song also became Jay-Z's highest charting single in Australia, where it peaked at number two. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), denoting shipment of 70,000 copies.
546	"'03 Bonnie & Clyde" broke into the top five of the Billboard Hot 100 at number four; it became the highest-charting single that references the famous bank robbers Bonnie and Clyde. The record was previously held by Georgie Fame's 1986 single "The Ballad of Bonnie and Clyde." Following the performance of "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" on Saturday Night Live (SNL) on November 2, 2002, its radio audience increased by 12%, allowing the song to advance into the top ten of the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, at number seven. This gave Jay-Z his 12th top 10 single, tying him with rapper P. Diddy, who had the same number of top 10 singles on that chart. "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was his first top 10 since his 2001 single "Girls, Girls, Girls". It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting sales of 500,000 copies.The song sold over 1 million copies in US.
547	Chris Robinson directed the song's accompanying music video and filmed in Mexico, during October 2002. June Ambrose was hired as the personal stylist, and Johnathon Schaech and Lance Reddick appear in the video as the police officers on their tail. Jay-Z and Beyoncé play a modern-day version of the 1930s bank robbers Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker. The video is loosely based on the American 1993 romance crime film True Romance, which stars Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette as two lovers on the run from cocaine dealers. The choreography used in the clip suggests a relationship beyond screen, as Jay-Z wraps his arm around Beyoncé while singing his part of the chorus. The video also marked a departure for the "clean-cut Beyoncé" and created a symbiotic relationship between her and Jay-Z, allowing them to exchange audiences. The video was premiered on MTV on November 8, 2002.
548	The music video begins as police officers and Reddick discuss the criminal duo and ways to catch them. As the song begins, Jay-Z is seen driving a gunmetal grey Aston Martin while Beyoncé sits in the passenger seat. As they drive through the sepia sands of Mexico, clips of the police from the beginning of the video are cut into the scene. As Jay-Z and Beyoncé pull over to a hotel, they cover the car to avoid notice from the police. As Beyoncé and Jay-Z count money in the bedroom, the police discover their hiding place and go upstairs only to find that the two have fled the scene in their car. Scenes of Beyoncé and Jay-Z at a Mexican bar are inter-cut with scenes of an intimate time in a phone-booth; behind the phone booth, spray-painted onto a wall is a tribute to Tupac Shakur. The duo again elude the police who are following one step behind. After Beyoncé performs her verse in an empty pool, the police form a blockade on the highway in an attempt to catch her and Jay-Z, only to be stumped again as two gas station attendant decoys are found driving the car. The video ends as Beyoncé and Jay-Z light a bonfire on the beach and drive away in a different car.
549	On October 8, 2002, Toni Braxton and her team released a statement claiming that Jay-Z's song "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" had stolen Braxton's idea to sample the 1996 Tupac Shakur song "Me and My Girlfriend". Braxton sampled Shakur's song on the track "Me & My Boyfriend", included on Braxton's album, More Than a Woman (2002). In a call to a New York radio station, hosted by Wendy Williams, Braxton stated that "Jay-Z and Beyoncé are messing with my money. They're trying to steal my mojo". Braxton said her song was recorded over the summer of 2002, and alleged that Jay-Z only decided to do "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" after she played her version of the song for Def Jam Recordings.
550	Jay is a talented dude. I don't think he would steal anything intentionally. It's an ill coincidence, and things happen for a reason. We'll see what happens behind it... I read it in the paper, and Jay and I were talking about it this morning and it was a little funny. I know he didn't intentionally make the same record she made. I don't think he even heard it. [My] reaction is, 'Sorry, it wasn't intentional.' Jay makes records and puts them out. This [sh--] is music. It's just music. We don't sit around and have a blueprint to [f---] anybody's life up. The music business has been good to us. I'm not getting into any beef or nothing over music.
551	Speaking for MTV News, Jay-Z responded to Braxton's claims: "I wouldn't want to take it from her. I don't even think like that. My first thought would be, 'Maybe I could call her up, maybe I could get on that record.' The most obvious [explanation] is it's neither one of our records. It's not like you made an original idea. She's not in hip-hop, but it happens in hip-hop often. We go to sample the same thing and my record came out first. I'm sorry. What can I do?" He went on saying that if he had known they were both planning to sample the same Tupac song, he would have arranged a duet with her.
552	On November 2, 2002, Jay-Z and Beyoncé performed the song together at Saturday Night Live (SNL). Later, on November 21, 2002 they appeared on MTV's TRL for Spankin' New Music Week where they also performed the song. In 2009, Beyoncé performed an abbreviated version of "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" during her I Am... Yours revue, held at the Encore Las Vegas Theatre in July and August. The song was later included on the 2009 live album I Am... Yours: An Intimate Performance at Wynn Las Vegas which was chronicling the revue. In August 2011, Beyoncé performed "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" again during her revue 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé and included the song on the DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4 released in November 2011. During the concerts, Beyoncé announced the song by saying, "It's 2002... I started to feel a little lonely till one day...". "'03 Bonnie & Clyde" was included on Jay-Z's live album Live in Brooklyn released on October 11, 2012 after he performed the song during eight shows in Brooklyn. In 2013, Jay-Z included the song on the set list of his Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.
553	I felt a little like that about my home at the time, having been away and seen this vastly different world of rock music which was totally different from the way I was brought up. People may not generally admit it but I think that when most people write songs there is more than one level to them – they'll be about one thing on the surface, but underneath they're probably trying, maybe even unconsciously, to say something about their own life, their own experience – and in nearly all my stuff, there is a personal feeling.
554	'40s Junction is a commercial-free music channel on the Sirius XM Radio platform, broadcasting on channel 73; as well as Dish Network channel 6073. The channel mainly airs big band, swing, and hit parade music from 1936 to 1949, with occasional songs from the early-1950s. Until May 7, 2015, the station was known as '40s on 4, with programming being broadcast on channel 4, as part of the "Decades" line-up of stations. It was later rechanneled to be nearer to stations featuring similar genres of music, such as jazz and standards. During its first four months on Ch. 73, the station was known simply as '40s. The station was rebranded as 40s Junction on August 13, 2015.
555	The 40s Junction name, and the station's longtime nickname, "The Savoy Express", refer to the passenger train−travel common in the 1940s. The name also lends reference to the popular 1941 jazz song Chattanooga Choo Choo. The original "Station Master" (Program Director) for the channel was Marlin Taylor, with Bob Moke serving as Music Director. Both have since departed, and the channel is currently programmed by Human Newman. The "voice" of the channel is Lou Brutus, who models his announcing style after that of Bing Crosby staff announcer, Ken Carpenter. In keeping with the railroad theme, the station's logo now features a train itself.
556	Similar to other XM "Decades" stations, prior to the 2008 merger with Sirius, the '40s channel was initially programmed to recreate the feeling of the '40s era. This was accomplished by broadcasting big band/swing music; recreated newscasts in which fictional reporter "Ed Baxter", voiced by Bill Schmalfeldt, would report on the day's top stories in a year from 1936 to 1949, as if they were current now; countdowns of the top 3 hit songs from the current week in a year from 1936 to 1949; World War II–era, patriotic songs; Spike Jones's joke novelty recordings; along with such features as the Record Museum, which played tracks from any year between 1920 and 1935. During Academy Award season, director Bob Moke would regularly introduce and play all of the Academy Award nominated songs for a particular year between 1936 and 1949.
557	In 1965, the D'Angelo brothers purchased a 2,000 sq.ft. retail space on Yawkey Way to sell Red Sox souvenirs. They now own and operate the official pro-shop at 19 Jersey Street across from Fenway Park: The Red Sox Team Store. On game days, the store operates within stadium confines and is open to ticketed patrons two hours before game time, throughout the game, and thirty minutes after the last pitch. The store opens at 9am daily. The company headquarters is located in Westwood, MA. In addition, they have a 200,000 sq.ft. warehouse in Brockton, MA.
558	The magazine, on both pulp and coated paper, about the size of Reader's Digest and Coronet, told of the changing times and of the new world coming. Readers in the forty-eight states learned about the territory of Alaska. FM broadcasting was going to give the air waves back to the listeners. Dr. Kinsey had some interesting news. John Gunther named all the white males who ran America.  Social Security, a decade old, was reviewed. Rheumatic fever was a major killer of children. Nathaniel Benchley ventured “Up in Benchley’s Room” and Albert Einstein recommended a few science books. Painter Jack Levine was hailed as a new young talent. A short story by Ralph Ellison, soon to be part of his new novel “Invisible Man,” appeared. Tasteful nudes and mildly funny cartoons were not eschewed.
559	Early in 1948, the magazine began to run advertising. Nevertheless, in May of that year, '48 wound up laying off its circulation department and then going to court for approval of a reorganization under the National Bankruptcy Act. According to Time magazine, despite the talents of its owner-contributors, The Magazine of the Year "had bought too much bottom-drawer stuff, because it could not afford the prices other magazines paid for top-drawer pieces". The Magazine of the Year came to an end with the June 1948 issue, after having published sixteen issues; at the time publisher Walter Ross ended publication, the magazine was $150,000 in debt after having cost its investors $700,000.
560	With the V-2 missiles came two types of the same disease. First is the Blood Death which kills the subject instantly in a gruesome way. The arteries become blocked and explode, the skin splits and blood pours from every orifice. The Slow Death has the same climax but takes longer to work, up to years, and weakens the subject, blackens their fingers and hands and bruises their body internally. Victims of the Slow Death are generally much weaker and slower to react than the AB negs, however some individuals (such as McGruder, Hubble's bodyguard) seem less prone to its debilitating effects.
561	The film opens on Judge Brand and his secretary, Tom Reeves, lounging in their office as the Judge reminisces about his life in the Old West. Brand tells Tom about how he and his partner, Adams, participated in the Gold Rush. Brand and Adams had both fallen in love with a woman, though Adams had eventually won her affection and the two were married and had a child. This state of affairs did not last long however, as Adams' wife eventually left him for another man, taking the child with her. Not long after, Brand and Adams struck it rich, however Adams' wife never came back. Brand concludes the story by asking Tom to go out west to repopulate and rebuild the town Brand and Adams had lived in, Nugget Notch. Both so that Brand can relive some of his earlier days, and to potentially find Adams' child, and the heir to his fortune.
562	Tom does not initially find success in his search for potential occupants of Nugget Notch, but eventually hears about a struggling exposition troupe themed around the Old West, run by a man named J. Gordon Castle. Among this troupe is an innocent woman called Peggy Babbot, along with her parents Pa and Ma Babbot. However, Peggy is constantly watched by a mysterious Mr. Jim Rayner. Tom proposes Judge Brand's idea to Mr. Castle, who agrees. On the way to Nugget Notch, Rayner threatens Pa Bobbet not to let Tom near Peggy, Pa begrudgingly obliges. Tom also writes to Judge Brand that he has assembled a population to live in Nugget Notch, but tells Brand that Rayner seems untrustworthy.
563	Upon arrival at Nugget Notch, the troupe begins renovating the town and preparing for Judge Brand's arrival. When the Judge finally arrives, he remarks that the townsfolk are not quite as rough and hardy as the authentic 49ers used to be, but he seems to settle in well. It is then that Raynor learns that the Judge came west partially to find the heir to Adams' fortune, which Rayner takes an interest in. That night, at a banquet held to celebrate Judge Brand's arrival, Brand recognizes a necklace Peggy is wearing and it is revealed that Peggy is in fact Adams' daughter and heiress, with her real name being Lorena Adams. After the banquet, Peggy/Lorena informs Tom and the Judge that Raynor is threatening to have Pa Bobbet killed unless he can give Raynor $1,000 by the next day. Tom decides to confront Raynor and tells him not to harm Peggy. 
564	Late in the night, Tom is kidnapped and blindfolded by Raynor, who lowers him via rope into a rock formation outside of town. The Judge notices that Tom is gone, and along with a man from the village go to find Tom. However, this was unnecessary as Tom was led out of the rocks by a friendly wolf. They then realize that there is, in fact, still gold in the rock formation. So the men set up a claim. The next day, as Tom and the Judge are talking, some of the townsfolk inform the two that Rayner has stolen all of the money, guns, and horses from the town during the night. It is then that Raynor himself appears and demands that the men hand over their pocket money at gunpoint. Raynor then kidnaps Peggy and makes a run for it. However, Judge Brand remembers a shortcut which allows him and Tom to ambush and capture Raynor using a rope.
565	The town decides to put Rayner on trial. During the proceedings it is revealed that Raynor was the man Adams' wife left Adams for, that Raynor had once been Pa Bobbet's partner and had used the death of a man Raynor had tried to steal from as blackmail against Bobbet for many years, and that Peggy was Pa Bobbet's real daughter all along. However, while all this is going on Rayner manages to undo his bindings, shoot Tom in the arm, and escape once again. But, at the last second, he falls off of his horse and is recaptured. The film ends with Judge Brand, Tom, and Peggy sitting together happily.
566	Similar to the other decades-themed channels, The '50s on 5 attempts to recreate the feel of 1950s radio. It uses similar DJ habits, jingles, period slang, and news updates. The channel was also used for XM's annual Pop Music music chronology, IT. However, unlike most satellite radio stations which play songs solely from a specific decade, the lineup of songs on The '50s on 5 is mostly from 1954 to 1963, a decade that spans from the start of the rock and roll era to immediately before the British Invasion. 40s Junction carries the early 1950s playlist alongside the late 30s and 40s music.
567	In Western classical music during the common practice period, chord progressions are used to structure a musical composition. The destination of a chord progression is known as a cadence, or two chords that signify the end or prolongation of a musical phrase. The most conclusive and resolving cadences return to the tonic or I chord; following the circle of fifths, the most suitable chord to precede the I chord is a V chord. This particular cadence, V–I, is known as an authentic cadence. However, since a I–V–I progression is repetitive and skips most of the circle of fifths, it is common practice to precede the dominant chord with a suitable predominant chord, such as a IV chord or a ii chord (in major), in order to maintain interest. In this case, the 50s progression uses a IV chord, resulting in the ubiquitous I–IV–V–I progression. The vi chord before the IV chord in this progression (creating I–vi–IV–V–I) is used as a means to prolong the tonic chord, as the vi or submediant chord is commonly used as a substitute for the tonic chord, and to ease the voice leading of the bass line: in a I–vi–IV–V–I progression (without any chordal inversions) the bass voice descends in major or minor thirds from the I chord to the vi chord to the IV chord.
568	'51 Dons is a 2014 documentary film directed by Ron Luscinski and written by Luscinski, Tom Davis and Danny Llewelyn. Narrated by Johnny Mathis, it covers the 1951 San Francisco Dons football team and its unique stand against racism. The team, including future NFL players and Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Bob St. Clair and Gino Marchetti, declined an invitation to play in the Orange Bowl that would have required them to leave their African-American players Ollie Matson and Burl Toler home. This act was one of the contributing factors that led to the end of organized football at the University of San Francisco. The university's athletic news director, Pete Rozelle, went on to become the commissioner of the NFL, where he reshaped American football.
569	In 1951, future Pro Football Hall of Famers Gino Marchetti, Bob St. Clair and Ollie Matson powered the University of San Francisco Dons to a 9–0 record. As one of the nation's top teams, USF seemed assured of their first-ever bowl bid  and a payout that would save their cash-strapped program. The Dons were invited to Miami under one condition: They take the field without their two African American stars, Matson and Burl Toler. The Dons refused. By choosing not to play, they set a precedent of racial equality more than a decade before the Civil Rights Movement. The Dons' stand against racism is recognized by contemporary African-American studies scholars Dr. Harry Edwards and Martin Luther King Jr.'s speech writer, Dr. Clarence Benjamin Jones, as evidence of sports acting as an engine for social justice in America. Both men state this case in the film.
570	 '60s Vibrations was a commercial-free music channel on Sirius Satellite Radio channel 6 and Dish Network channel 6006 that plays all-60’s and some early '70s music. Unlike its counterpart at XM Satellite Radio, The 60s on 6, it was not exactly decade-specific; rather, its musical focus was on the years 1964-69, a period in which the British Invasion, the Motown explosion, and other creative forces transformed the pop music landscape. SIRIUS Gold carried the early '60s playlist with the '50s music.  The playlist also included select titles from the early '70s and some from the earlier '60s. Core artists include the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Temptations, the Rolling Stones, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Marvin Gaye, Tommy James and the Shondells, and Simon and Garfunkel. There were daily segments devoted to British Invasion music ("Tea and Crumpets"), surf music ("Surf's Up"), and bubblegum music ("Bubblegum").
571	With the merger of many Sirius XM channels on November 12, 2008, there were some changes to 60s on 6. The channel's playlist, which had once exceeded 3,000 songs was sliced to emphasize Top 10 hits more, with most of the lower-charting tracks as well as many of the crossover and novelty hits of the era removed and abandoned from the rotation. Pat Clarke, who helmed the channel since the 2004 departure of  Program Director and channel creator, Cleveland Wheeler, was dismissed along with another disk jockey, Marty "with the Party" Thompson. Phlash Phelps and Terry "Motormouth" Young were spared, and "Broadway" Bill Lee and Mike Kelly joined the airstaff. Lee eventually moved to the '70s on 7 channel. Cousin Brucie began a live Saturday all-request show. Wolfman Jack was moved into an early afternoon block, and was eventually eliminated altogether, along with other channel fixtures such as the Sonic Sound Salute, Sweet Sixteen Music Machine countdown, and Chickenman.
572	This song marked Davis's second single release upon his departure from Bang Records to Arista, the first being "Cool Night". The style of "'65 Love Affair" was reminiscent of such blue-eyed soul groups as Hall & Oates, a vein that Davis had not explored before. Davis had originally titled the song "'55 Love Affair", but Arista felt that some modernization was needed to target an audience whose teenage years had occurred in the 1960s, including Davis himself. As Arista pointed out, Davis was only 7 years old in 1955, too young for a "love affair", but was 17 years old in 1965, perfect for the song.
573	Josh Scogin's former band, The Chariot, played their final show in November 2013. Just over a week later, Scogin teased an announcement with a countdown timer on the website theyare68.com; when the timer ended in December 2013, Scogin revealed that he had formed a new band named '68 and posted a two-song EP titled Midnight for sale online. The title of the EP and its two songs—"Three Is a Crowd" and "Third Time Is a Charm"—are significant to Scogin; the use of the number three in the song titles represents the third act of his life following his stints in Norma Jean and The Chariot, and Scogin also explained that three represents "that thought process of continuing on in my head: 'Three's a charm,' oh, this is gonna be great or 'three's a crowd,' like we should've stuck with The Chariot." The initial pressing of Midnight sold out in less than one day; independent record label No Sleep Records re-released it with new artwork on 1 April 2014.
574	'68 toured in April and May 2014, opening for Chiodos, Emarosa, Our Last Night, and Hands Like Houses, and in May 2014 announced their signing to Good Fight Music and eOne Music to release their debut album In Humor and Sadness, which was released two months later on 8 July 2014. To promote the album, '68 released "Track Two: e" on YouTube as a pair videos that had to be played in unison in order to hear the song correctly. Scogin said of releasing the song this way: "[S]omeone will have one computer and invite a friend over that has another computer, they will spend several minutes struggling and laughing at trying to sync up the two videos perfectly." The song "Track One: R" was also available for online streaming ahead of the album's release, and in August, '68 released a music video for "Track One: R" directed by former Norma Jean and Underoath member Daniel Davison. The band's first tour in support of In Humor and Sadness featured Listener (whose vocalist Dan Smith previously guested on The Chariot's 2010 album, Long Live) and Homeless Gospel Choir.
575	The father escaped the Soviet invasion of Budapest and now runs a Hungarian restaurant that is not doing well financially. The younger of his two sons is gay and struggling with coming out. His dad disowns him when he finally does. The older son is involved in the counterculture, gets kicked out of college, buys a motorcycle, starts dating a Maoist, and is also disowned by his father. The older of the sons runs afoul of an outlaw motorcycle club; the younger of the two sons gets drafted but is rejected because of his homosexuality. The older one joins his younger brother in a gay rights protest.
576	The initial '68 Comeback lineup consisted of Monsieur Evans on vocals, guitar, and blues harp; Jack Taylor of the Monster Truck Five and Darin Lin Wood of the Red Devils on guitar; ex-Gloryhole member, Dan Brown, on bass; and Peggy O'Neil, formerly of The Gories, on drums. With this lineup the band released a number of well-received 7" singles and then began the first leg of a 60-day, 42-city U.S. tour. The tour immediately ran into problems when drummer Peggy O'Neil was unable to perform, leaving the band without a drummer in the midst of a cross-country tour. This position was eventually filled by then-Compulsive Gamblers and future Oblivians frontman Greg Cartwright.
577	With the success of their first tour under their belt, the band re-entered the studio, completing their first EP, Paper Boy Blues, in 1993, and their first album, Mr. Downchild, in 1994. The band continued its rigorous release schedule, issuing a number of 7" before heading back into the studio, this time with Walter Daniels and backed by former stand-in drummer Greg Cartwright's Oblivians for what would eventually become the Walter Daniels Plays With Monsieur Jeffrey Evans & The Oblivians At Melissa's Garage" EP, later re-released with additional tracks as "Melissa's Garage Revisited."
578	'70s on 7 (or just The '70s) is a commercial-free, satellite radio channel on Sirius XM Radio channel 7 and Dish Network channel 6007 (channel 099-07 on Dish's Hopper DVR units). It plays pop, rock, soul and disco music from the 1970s, mostly hits. Prior to XM’s merger with Sirius, Arbitron reported that '70s on 7 was the fourth most listened to channel, with a cume of 667,400 listeners per week. As part of the Sirius/XM merger on November 12, 2008, The '70s was merged with Sirius' Totally '70s and took its current name.
579	Much like the other decades channels, '70s on 7 attempts to recreate the feel of 1970s radio. It uses similar DJ techniques, jingles, 1970s slang, and news updates. Kid Kelly formerly, of WHTZ New York, programs the channel with Human Numan, a long time contemporary hit radio personality. Creative imaging is produced by producer Mitch Todd who oversees all producers and production on the music channels and the marketing division. Due to being commercial-free, it does not recreate any sponsor spots. The channel was also used for XM's annual pop music chronology, IT.
580	'71 is a 2014 British historical action thriller film written by Gregory Burke and directed by Yann Demange (in his feature directorial debut). Set in Northern Ireland, it stars Jack O'Connell, Sean Harris, David Wilmot, Richard Dormer, Paul Anderson and Charlie Murphy, and tells the story of a British soldier who becomes separated from his unit during a riot in Belfast at the height of the Troubles in 1971. Filming began on location in Blackburn, Lancashire, in April 2013 and continued in Sheffield, Leeds, and Liverpool. The film was funded by the British Film Institute, Film4, Creative Scotland and Screen Yorkshire. The film had its premiere in the competition section of the 64th Berlin International Film Festival, held in February 2014. The film was praised, particularly for O'Connell's performance and Demange's direction.
581	Gary Hook, a new recruit to the British Army, is sent to Belfast in 1971 in the early years of the Troubles. Under the leadership of the inexperienced Second Lieutenant Armitage, his platoon is deployed to a volatile area where Irish Catholics, Republicans, Ulster Protestants, and Loyalists live side by side. The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of civilians. A crowd gathers to protest and provoke the British troops who, though heavily armed, can only respond by trying to hold the crowd back.
582	One soldier is hit by a rock and drops his L1A1 rifle to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd's protest escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten and disarmed by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point-blank range by the  Provisional IRA gunman Paul Haggerty. Hook flees through streets and back alleys and hides in an outhouse until dark.
583	A Protestant youngster brings Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room, constructing a bomb under the guidance of Sergeant Lewis, a member of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the British Army's covert counter-insurgency unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the Provisional IRA and  Official IRA factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.
584	Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan called '71 "a tense thriller from Britain that so adroitly joins physical intensity, emotional authenticity and political acuity that you may find yourself forgetting to take a breath." Manohla Dargis of The New York Times singled out Jack O'Connell for praise, saying, "Mr. O'Connell runs away with '71, in which his character's every emotional, psychological and physical hurdle makes for kinetic cinema."  The Hollywood Reporter critic Leslie Felperin noted of Yann Demange's direction, "A big part of [Demange's] achievement resides in the casting of such a veteran crew of character actors in the first place, but credit is due for coaxing such subtle performances." Jonathan Romney in Film Comment praised the originality of the film, "a rare hybrid between hard-nosed realism, on the cusp of a quasi-documentary style, and genre thriller-adventure", while criticising the opening and closing scenes as conventional.
585	"'74-'75" became a big hit in Europe in 1995, particularly in Sweden and Norway, where it topped the singles charts, as well as in Belgium, Denmark, France, Iceland, and Switzerland, reaching the top 5 in these regions. It ended 1995 as Europe's 23rd-best-performing song, climbing to No. 8 on the Eurochart Hot 100. In addition, it was their only top-20 hit in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at No. 14 in August 1995, and it also became a success in Germany, where it peaked at No. 7 and remained on the airplay charts for 57 weeks. In March 1996, the single re-appeared on the UK Singles Chart at No. 21. Following the songs's success, the Connells embarked on a European tour with Def Leppard.
586	 '76 is an eight-issue 2007 comic book limited series published by Image Comics, and written by B. Clay Moore and Seth Peck, and illustrated by Ed Tadem and Tigh Walker. Each issue of the mini-series, both set in the year 1976, focus on separate, ongoing storylines; one story takes place in New York City, and the other in Los Angeles. Both are crime dramas, drawn in monochrome and the series draws heavily upon 1970s 'street' culture. The series has been reviewed as not so much "a flip-book" but instead "more like a drive-in double feature".
587	Seth Peck noted that he had wanted to create a "kick-ass crime story without playing off of the 1970s clichés like disco and pet rocks", Peck explains. “Most of the characters in Cool wouldn't look out of place walking around the Los Angeles of today. Fashion is cyclical and drugs never really went away." Peck jokingly notes that while his story differs from Moore's in that the kung-fu element is missing, it is nevertheless a "timeless story about midgets, strippers, and cocaine ... very Shakespearean stuff. While he agrees that his story has elements of Elmore Leonard's stories, Peck notes that he was also influenced by the film contributions of Quentin Tarantino, The French Connection film, the music of Steely Dan and the works of Marcel Proust.
588	Moore notes that while they had initially planned to start the series closer to the start of the decade, there was something about '76 "that resonates.The Bicentennial, the beginning of the recovery from Watergate, a period of national soul-searching as the dreams of the 1960s crashed and burned, and an explosion of exploitation pop culture, (like) movies, television, comics, magazines that we knew we wanted to tap into.” Moore specifically notes these influences ran the gamut from Bruce Lee to Gordon Parks to Tavares to Deadly Hands of Kung Fu to Richard Dragon, Kung Fu Fighter.
589	Moore notes that they decided to add pages to the comic listing the sports games and songs playing during the period so as to provide a backdrop and soundtrack of sorts to the stories. Peck notes this as well, pointing out that one of his characters, Peter Walker, uses the alias of "Edmund Fitzgerald", an homage to the Gordon Lightfoot song, The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald, which turns into a running joke, as the mob figures chasing after him ask around town for the whereabouts of "Edmund Fitzgerald". Moore states that making comics is "very much like making movies with no budget limitations", and notes that "this comic is the movie I would make if I could."
590	Ojukwu always had fantasies about making military movies, so much that he followed many coup stories. When the ’76 project came along, he had to do a lot more readings and research, and also consult scholars on the crucial aspects of the story, to ensure historical accuracy; over a year was spent on the pre-production stage of the film. The historical account of ’76 had the support of the Nigerian Military, as the script went through a seven-month investigation and approval period before filming started. The military also assigned personnel to train the actors and guide the military aspect of the film. During the film's development, the director tried to minimize violence as he wanted people to focus on the story and not get distracted or pissed off by gory images. Eight period cars of the 1970s were refurbished to be used in the film.
591	When the merge of XM and Sirius Satellite Radio music and talk channels occurred on November 12, 2008, Rick Stacy was named the channel's program director, and the airstaff consisted of the four surviving original MTV "veejays" - Nina Blackwood, Mark Goodman, Alan Hunter and Martha Quinn, carrying over the lineup of Sirius's Big '80s channel. '80s on 8 was simulcast on both XM and Sirius, and channel imaging was revised to include the phrase "Sirius XM Radio".  It also became Sirius XM Radio's first and only channel to phase out the apostrophe (like on most decades channels on Sirius XM), as they changed their logo entirely (other channels such as The 50s on 5 and The 90s on 9 did so, but the rest of the logos were updated).  However, with the reintroduction of the VJ big 40, the 80s on 8 is starting to sound more like the Sirius channel The Big 80s, complete with a schedule somehow reminiscent of that channel.
592	The '90s on 9 (or just The '90s) is the name of Sirius XM Radio's 1990s commercial-free music channel, heard on Sirius XM channel 9 and Dish Network channel 6009. The channel focuses mostly on hit-driven R&B, Hip-Hop, Rock, Dance and Techno tracks from the 1990s. Many of the station IDs are spoofs of movies, TV characters, songs and TV commercials that were popular during the '90s. Occasionally, lesser-known '90s songs are played, preceded by the "five disc CD changer set on random" tagline. The channel's logo features a compact disc in place of the zero, representing the popularity of CDs in the nineties.
593	The service signed on September 25, 2001, and broadcasts on Sirius XM channel 9 and on Dish Network channel 6009. It was also heard on DirecTV until February 9, 2010.  On November 12, 2008, it was added to Sirius, replacing the original Pulse on Sirius channel 9, whereas the new Pulse, formerly Flight 26 was added to channel 12 on the Sirius side. This is Sirius's first all-1990s channel since I-90 signed off on November 4, 2002.  The old Pulse carried a 1990s & hot AC hybrid, whereas the new Pulse just carries modern AC music.  In addition, it also replaced the online-only Super Shuffle channel on Sirius, last heard on satellites in mid-2008. On February 3, 2014, the channel became jockless when both Jo Jo Morales and KT Harris were let go in a cost-cutting move. It remained jockless until May 26, 2015, when former MTV VJ Downtown Julie Brown, who also hosts the weekend's "Back In The Day Replay Countdown," began hosting the channel on a daily basis.
594	'96 was released worldwide on 4 October 2018 and performed well at the box-office. The film won several accolades at several nominations. At the 2018 Filmfare Awards South, the film won five awards, including Best Actor and Best Actress. Trisha won two awards for Best Actress at two nominations, Ananda Vikatan Cinema Awards and Norway Tamil Film Festival Awards. The film was nominated for several categories at Edison Awards, but did not receive a win. The film was remade by Preetham Gubbi in Kannada as 99 (2019), and by Premkumar himself in Telugu as Jaanu (2020).
595	Ram and Jaanu finally meet and find it uncomfortable to interact with each other, but gradually get along. Their friends talk about Jaanu's married life in Singapore and disclose that Ram is still single and has not moved on. After the reunion party, both go out on a drive. Jaanu reveals how she could not forget Ram and would have traded anything just to have met him once back then. She narrates how circumstances forced her to marry someone else. Then, Ram asks Jaanu if she really does not remember the day he came to her college to meet her. Ram says that he and Murali waited in front of Jaanu's college to meet her and passed on a message through a student. Surprisingly, Jaanu refused to meet Ram and forbade him to contact her again. He returned sadly and never tried to meet her since then. Jaanu is devastated listening to this and reveals that she never saw them at her college and thought it was her stalker who was troubling her. Ram tells that except for the mistake of assuming that she hated him, he knew everything about her life. He also tells about seeing her from afar at her wedding. Jaanu is heartbroken because she felt his presence and expected him to come for her until the last minute. Both feel sad about their misfortune and finally, come to terms with everything that happened in their lives. Jaanu expresses her desire to spend the final few hours with Ram before she catches the flight back home.
596	They go out into the city and then to a restaurant and catch up on more memories. There, they meet Ram's photography students who assume Jaanu is his wife and request her to share their story. Jaanu obliges and narrates an improvised version of the time when Ram tried to meet Jaanu at her college. She tells about how they finally met and made up and have been together ever since and got married. Ram feels awkward but tries his best to play along. The students leave and Ram and Jaanu get wet in the rain. So he asks her to visit his apartment to freshen up.
597	At his apartment, Jaanu is visibly upset that Ram does not have a love life and requests him to move on and get married and have a family. She finally sings Ram's favourite song for him, a song that she had purposefully avoided singing in school in spite of his repeated requests. Ram shows Jaanu a collection of their old memories like love poems, dried flowers, and their school uniforms. They realize that time is running out and go back to Jaanu's hotel to get ready for her flight in a few hours. Jaanu is sad knowing that she will leave Chennai and Ram very soon. At the airport, Ram escorts her to the boarding gate and they bid a teary farewell. Jaanu then gets into the flight and leaves.
598	From May 2017, Prem Kumar first talked about the film, telling that Vijay Sethupathi would play the role of a travel photographer, and that the film revolved around "characters who belong to the same batch – 1996", revealing the meaning of the film's title. Prem Kumar had written the entire script in 20 days in December 2015 during the Chennai floods when he was stuck in his apartment. According to Prem Kumar, the inspiration for the story came from his high school reunion. He missed the reunion but when talking to his classmates who attended the function he became fascinated about two people they were speaking about and began meeting the two and developing a story around their characters. The film's story was originally supposed to happen over a week, before the time span was changed to 24 hours, and eventually to a night.
599	The technical crew of the film includes cinematography by N. Shanmuga Sundaram who also did  Aandavan Kattalai, music by Govind Vasantha, edited by R. Govindaraj, artwork by Vinoth Raj Kumar, and lyrics by Uma Devi and Karthik Netha. The crew was then looking for suitable actors to play the younger versions of Sethupathi and Trisha's characters, which delayed the commencement of principal photography. The team eventually selected Aditya Bhaskar, son of actor M. S. Bhaskar, and Gouri G. Kishan for the roles, both making their acting debuts with '96. Devadharshini's daughter, Niyathi Kadambi, played the younger version of her role. Subhashree Kaarthik Vijay, who was recruited as the costume signer, was a close friend of Prem Kumar and created the look of the lead female character Jaanu based on her own style. The team shot a scene where the lead characters meet singer S. Janaki, though this was later deleted from the film. Post-release, the makers uploaded the scene to YouTube.
600	The song "Kaathalae Kaathalae", which was featured in the first 1-minute teaser, was a slower, "ambiance version" of a part of the "Anthaathi" song that Govind had produced because "he was in the mood" but was not meant to be included in the film or the soundtrack album. When the teaser song went viral, Govind Vasantha worked on it and made a 3-minute song that went on to be featured in the album as well as in the film. Chinmayi sang all the female portions in the songs since she also dubbed for the lead female character Jaanu, while Gouri TP, who spoke dubbing for younger Jaanu, sang the song "Yean" which features younger Jaanu on screen. A poetry written by Prem Kumar was added by Govind Vasantha to the end of "Anthaathi", which was recited by actor Nassar although he did not act in the film. "Anthaathi", considered the "central piece of the '96 album", was composed for promotional purposes and not used in the film. Govind had reused the song "Yamunai Aatrile" which was originally composed by Ilayaraaja, from the 1991 film Thalapathi, and was released on 15 February 2019.
601	A reviewer from The Indian Express wrote, "Govind Vasantha creates a soundtrack that leaves me bereft of adjectives to describe how beautiful it is. Govind gives us an eclectic yet symbiotic soundscape, a soundtrack that brims with emotion that touches your soul. There’s love, heartbreak, melancholy, questions, silence and of course love". Surendhar MK of Firstpost wrote, "at a time when Tamil music scene continues to be dominated by EDM-laden pieces and heavily auto-tuned vocals, the OST of '96 comes as a breath of fresh air that touches the soul and mind quite effortlessly with Govind Vasantha's rejuvenating compositions. It would definitely not be an overstatement to call '96 the best Tamil soundtrack of 2018". Sharanya CR of The Times of India wrote, "Govind Vasantha gives us one of the best albums of this year and sets a benchmark for romance in Kollywood". musicaloud.com wrote, "Govind Vasantha (formerly Menon) finally gets his well-deserved big break in Tamil, and knocks it right out of the park!", giving it a score of 4.5 out of 5. Karthik from milliblog.com called it "easily the best Tamil soundtrack of the year (yet)". as did Siddharth K. from Sify who also called it "one unique musical experience". In contrast, Archana Nathan of scroll.in wrote that "barring a few instances of brilliance, the rest of the soundtrack does not leave much of an impression".
602	The first look poster of the film was released on 14 February 2017, coinciding with Valentine's Day. A new poster, featuring Vijay Sethupathi was released on 1 August 2017. The first look featuring Vijay Sethupathi and Trisha, was released on 12 July 2018, and on the same day, the makers unveiled the teaser of the film. The teaser received positive response from viewers and crossed 3 million views within 3 days of its release. The trailer of the film was released on 24 August 2018, coinciding with the film's audio launch. The trailer crossed 2 million views within its release. Post release, the makers unveiled few deleted scenes from the film.
603	Anupama Subramaniam of Deccan Chronicle, who gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5, was in high praise of director Prem Kumar as she wrote that he had "not made a film, but woven pure and impeccable poetry on celluloid", going on to add that "Prem's honest attempt of portraying the true essence of love without taking any cinematic liberties makes '96 the kind of genre-defining film that creates a benchmark for many years to come", while hailing Trisha's performance as her "best-ever...till date". IANS gave it a rare 5 stars out of 5 and said, "as we get to the climax and we get one of the most heartwarming moments of the film, it makes '96 a highly satisfying story of unfulfilled romance". Behindwoods called '96 a "breezy and heartwarming romantic tale that Tamil cinema audience shouldn't miss". Sify named it "one of the best films in a long time", while giving it a 4 rating out of 5. Janani K. of India Today gave it 4 stars out of 5 and called it a "poignant romantic tale" and a "tribute to unconditional love". Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News called the film "a classic love story that will be fondly remembered".
604	Sreedhar Pillai of Firstpost called the film a "refreshingly fresh romantic trip down the memory lane with outstanding performances by its charming lead pair". M. Suganth of The Times of India gave it 3.5 stars out of 5 and said that "there is a lot to fall in love with '96, a wistful romantic film about a past romance...But what sets Prem Kumar's film apart from the others is that it gives equal importance to the romance of its female lead". Vikram Venkatesen of The Quint wrote "'96 has very well changed Tamil romance for good, thanks to its high dependence on music and realism in conveying nostalgia". Priyanka Thirumurthy of The News Minute wrote, "the film’s screenplay is gripping. It has you on the edge of your seat for what are seemingly the most inane activities – school attendance, conversations over coffee and even a ride in the metro". Sudhir Srinivasan of The New Indian Express felt that '96 was a "fascinating film, a fascinating idea...an idea, I loved a bit too much, not to care about the[se] missteps. It needed to be a bit more bitingly real" but concluded that "yet, 96, no doubt, works". Baradwaj Rangan wrote, "The only problem is the slump in the second half...But the premise is so affecting, it keeps us invested" and concluded, "I walked out of the film satisfied that whatever Ram and Janaki decide to make of their future, his ink-splattered shirt from school and the dupatta of her uniform will live together, happily ever after".
605	In late October 2018, a month after '96's release, Suresh, an assistant director of Bharathiraja, alleged that he had written a script called 92 and that '96 was based on his own script. Few days later Prem Kumar hosted a press conference and said that he had registered his script in 2016 and also added that he had written a spin-off novel of what happens to the lead character afterwards. The film was also reported to have "uncanny similarities" with the 2016 film Blue Jay, with Prem Kumar admitting to it, although he added that he had already registered his film before Blue Jay released. Director R. Chandru had accused that the movie had similarities with his 2013 movie Charminar.
606	The song has Eminem disposing of the corpse of his ex-wife, Kim Mathers, in the lake with his then-infant daughter Hailie. The sounds played at the beginning of the song, including the jingling of keys and the slamming of a car door, imply that Eminem put Kim's body in the trunk of his car. These are the same sounds played at the end of the song "Kim" by Eminem. In "Kim", the lines immediately before the sounds are heard. Eminem got the idea to write this song at a time when Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter.
607	AllMusic highlighted and praised the song: "notorious track where he imagines killing his wife and then disposing of the body with his baby daughter in tow" and critic noted that this song is connected with Eminem's life struggles. Steve "Flash" Juon called the remix bad and he continued, "[It is] lifeless and oddly out of place among an album full of mostly dope cuts." Rob Sheffield wrote, "[T]he wife-killing jokes of “’97 Bonnie and Clyde” aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks’." Entertainment Weekly gave a positive opinion: "In the album’s funniest slice of black humor, a smart-ass parody of Will Smith’s unctuous ”Just the Two of Us” called ”97′ Bonnie & Clyde,” Eminem and his baby daughter take a pleasant drive to a lake — into which he tosses the dead body of the child's mother. Sending up the gooey sentiments and pop melody of the Smith hit, Eminem raps: ”Mama said she wants to show you how far she can float/And don’t worry about that little boo-boo on her throat.”
608	The demos were recorded in what the band refers to as 'The Last Golden Age of Demonstrations', the demo sessions for what would become their fourth album, 2002's Here Comes the Zoo. All of the songs from that album appear in demo form here, with the exception of "5th Ave. Crazy". Also, three of the songs from The No Fun EP, which were the only three songs that weren't covers on that release, appear here in demo form. The disc is rounded out by five songs which were all previously unreleased, with the exception of "Halcion Daze" which was previously released on a compilation, in the same form as it is here. That makes it the only song whose version appears on this album to have been previously released.
609	The contents of the trunk of Wilden's car is revealed to be a pig's corpse. The girls flee the scene, with Mona removing the disk showing footage of Ashley running over Wilden. In an attempt to earn some of their trust, Mona reveals a bunch of secrets to the PLLs. The next morning, the girls discover Wilden dead in the street by the church surrounded by coroners. It is revealed that Wilden was one of two people who wore the Queen of Hearts costume on the Halloween train. Mona says the other was Melissa but the computer is hacked and wiped before she can prove it. Mona is now "A"'s target along with the rest of the Liars.
610	Jessica DiLaurentis returns to Rosewood, but her intentions are unclear. Toby receives a text from "A" asking for the "A" van in exchange for information about his mother's death. "A" plants Ashley's cell phone in Wilden's casket, which Spencer and Mona retrieve based on a tip from "A." At Wilden's funeral, a mysterious woman dressed in a black veil appears and the PLLs meet Detective Gabriel Holbrook who is investigating the murders of Detective Wilden and Garrett Reynolds. The Liars and Mona then receive a text message from "A," which reveals that she was present the night they found Wilden's car and caught a video of it.
611	The episode was written and directed by showrunner I. Marlene King, making it the second episode which she has directed. The title of the episode was announced on March 5, 2013, by Entertainment Online. In addition, it was announced that Marion, Toby's mother, would be introduced in the season premiere. The episode featured the songs "Kill Of The Night" by Gin Wigmore, "Whispers" by Dave Baxter, "If I Lose Myself" by OneRepublic, "Hurricane" by Ms Mr, "Bodies" by The Duke Spirit and "The Devil Within" by Digital Daggers. The episode focuses on the Liars trying to figure out what happened at the Lodge and to get answers from Mona regarding "A". It focuses on Hanna becoming friends with Mona again, Emily's focus on getting into colleges, Aria dealing with the aftermath of breaking up with Ezra and Spencer trying to solve what happened at the Lodge. It also includes Jessica DiLaurentis, Alison's mother, moving back to Rosewood.
612	The 'A' of Charlemagne is a relic gifted to the Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy by the emperor Charlemagne himself. It is a gold and silver open triangle with ornate jewels on the arms. The base is stronger and serves more of a structural purpose rather than an aesthetic purpose. The piece served a greater purpose over time as the attraction to the church became more focused on visiting the relic that Charlemagne presented to the church rather than its original function of honoring Saint Faith.  The church itself was a common destination of medieval pilgrimage, and the change in purpose for these pilgrimages became highly focused on visiting this relic and attracted a different audience than before.
613	The 'A' of Charlemagne is an open triangle made of wood that is varnished with silver-gilt. At the peak of the triangle is a circular piece that houses a large, polished gem on the frontal side. Below the gem sit two angels made by repoussé metal working. Both angels glance upwards toward the gem, and one angel holds an object perceived to be a lamp. The rear side of the gem is molded in a similar fashion to the angels. In the early 1950s, Jean Taralon disassembled the piece for cleaning purposes and made many discoveries about the history of the work. The wood was determined to be walnut but various sections of the “A” dated to two distinctly different time periods. He determined the base and gem to be much older, and, therefore, the arms of the piece were considered replacements on which the gems were carefully replaced.
614	The stark contrast between the architecture of the base and the attached arms of the piece is evident. With the exception of the angels, the base serves more of a practical purpose rather than contributing to the larger purpose of the work. The arms and the gem at the apex are more ornate and display the extravagance of Charlemagne's gift, which signifies its influence. Reliquaries are intended to house physical relics, but the “A” is unique in that its symbolic importance is more tightly linked to its political and economic power.
615	When the Abbey Church of Saint Faith declared that Charlemagne gifted to them the “A,” the church also welcomed the authority of Charlemagne's name. A small church was legitimized by one proclamation in the beginning, but once Charlemagne was at the pinnacle of his power, the entire purpose of pilgrimages to the church changed. The relic became independent of Saint Faith and what the church was supposed to represent. Charlemagne's influence single-handedly accomplished this, and he was rewarded with a mutualistic relationship between himself and the church. The church honors this attachment, by placing him at the right hand of the Christ in its Last Judgement sculpture above the entrance.
616	The legend of how the “A” ended up at the Abbey Church of Saint Faith says that Charlemagne actually founded twenty-three churches, each of which were given a letter in the order by which they were founded. By this legend, the Abbey Church of Saint Faith was given the “A” and thus was the first church to be founded, but there is no way to be sure because not all of the twenty-three churches received letters. Another reason to question this theory of assigning prestige by a stunning, gold relic is that whether it appears to be an “A” is in the eye of the beholder because there is no crossbar of the “A.” This calls for interpretation as to why the church touts this specific relic. The answer lies in what a relic of this importance would physically produce for the church. Medieval pilgrimages were important to the success of the church because pilgrims were often expected to make offerings to the saints at their respective churches. By having a relic that pilgrims desired to see, they are able to attract a new, larger audience.
617	Pilgrimages in the medieval time period had an unspoken mutual agreement between the pilgrims and the churches or abbeys to which they visited. Pilgrims were expected to make offerings to the respective deity of each church or abbey, and in return, they received the benefits of spiritual guidance and miracles, as well as some type of physical safety. The “A” and many other reliquaries became sources of income for the churches. Although the money was ultimately used for practical up-keep and caring for the needs of pilgrims, it became important for the reliquaries to be upheld in the highest regard in order to keep a steady income flow. The prominence generated by the "A" heightened the major conflict between The Abbey Church at Conques and the nearby church, Figeac. They were known to be in constant conflict with one another and they often called to their reliquaries to lament their status upon each other. By having the “A,” they could legitimize the belief that the reliquary is prestigious and impose this influence over pilgrims who would then become more likely to visit Conques, instead of Figeac.
618	Meanwhile, her principal Sufi masters were Jamāl al-Dīn Ismā‘īl al-Ḥawwārī (fl. late ninth/fifteenth century) and his successor Muḥyī al-Dīn Yaḥyá al-Urmawī (fl. ninth-tenth/fifteenth-sixteenth centuries), whom she held in high regard. Probably in 1475, ‘Ā’ishah undertook the pilgrimage to Mecca. She was married to Aḥmad ibn Muḥammad Ibn Naqīb al-Ashrāf (d. 909/1503), from the prominent ‘Alid family of Damascus, also noted for their scholarship; by ‘Ā’ishah's reckoning, Aḥmad was descended from Muḥammad's daughter Faṭimah and her husband ‘Alī, via their son al-Ḥusayn. ‘Ā’ishah and Aḥmad had two known children, a son, ‘Abd al-Wahhāb (b. 897/1489), and a daughter, Barakah (b. 899/1491).
619	In 919/1513, ‘Ā’ishah and her son moved from Damascus to Cairo, returning to Damascus in 923/1517. ‘Ā’ishah's goal may have been to secure the career of her son. On the way, their caravan was raided by bandits near Bilbeis, who stole their possessions, including ‘Ā’ishah's writings. It appears that in Cairo, she and her son were hosted by Maḥmūd ibn Muḥammad ibn Ajā (b. 854/1450, d. 925/1519), who was personal secretary and foreign minister to the Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Qansuh al-Ghuri (d. 922/1516). Ibn Ajā helped ‘Abd al-Wahhāb find work in the chancery and helped ‘Ā’ishah enter into Cairo's intellectual circles; ‘Ā’ishah went on to write him 'several glowing panegyrics'.
620	Fayḍ al-faḍl wa-jam‘ al-shaml (The Emanation of Grace and the Gathering of the Union) is a collection of over 300 long poems in which ʿĀ’ishah 'described mystical states and praised variously Muhammad, the founder of her order 'Abd al-Qadir Jilani, and her own Sufi shaykhs. She used technical Sufi terminology and typical Sufi poetic motifs such as wine and love in her poems'. They seem to date from throughout ʿĀ’ishah's life up to her move to Cairo, and show her command of almost all Arabic poetic forms of the time.
621	According to R.A. Caulk, Emir 'Abd Allah was the son of Muhammad ibn `Ali `Abd ash-Shakur by Kadija, the daughter of Emir `Abd al-Karim ibn Muhammad. To secure his hold on the emirate of Harar, his father had married 'Abd Allah to the daughter of Ahmad III ibn Abu Bakr, his predecessor. When the Egyptians evacuated Harar, 'Abd Allah became the logical choice to rule Harar. He was given "a few hundred soldiers trained by one of the British officers, 300 to 400 rifles, some cannon, and munitions, a force hardly sufficient to garrison Harar and Jaldessa, let alone police the traderoutes and ensure the security of the state."
622	Emir 'Abd Allah responded to the first Ethiopian military probe with a night attack on their camp at Hirna that included fireworks; the Ethiopians panicked at the pyrotechnics and fled toward the Asabot and Awash Rivers. When the Negus Menelik personally led a second attack a few months later, the Emir misjudged the quality of these troops and attempted to repeat his earlier success of a second night attack. "Had he allowed the enemy to attack the walled city, where his few Krupp cannon might have been effective, the Shoans might have suffered a defeat with serious political consequences," Marcus notes. However, the Battle of Chelenqo destroyed the Emir's army in fifteen minutes and, with his wives and children, the Emir fled into the empty country east of Harar. He left his uncle Ali Abu Barka to submit to Menelik and ask clemency for Harar.
623	Abd al-'Aziz ibn Muhammad al-Qahiri al-Wafa'i known as Ibn al-Aqba'i (1408–1471) was an Egyptian astronomer and mathematician in the 15th century. He was born in 811 H.E. (1408 AD) and died in 876 H.E (1471 AD). Some sources say that he died in 874 or 879 H.E. He was a student of Ibn al-Majdi and Nur al-din al-Naqqash. He became a time keeper at the Mu'ayyad Mosque in Cairo. He also became the chief of the time keepers of the Azhar mosque and the Maridani Mosque. He was interested in the calculation of the local times of cities based on their latitude and longitude. He invented an astronomical device called Da'irah al-Mu'addal.
624	ʿAbd al-Hamīd ibn Turk (fl. 830), known also as ʿAbd al-Hamīd ibn Wase ibn Turk Jili (Arabic: ابومحمد عبدالحمید بن واسع بن ترک الجیلی‎) was a ninth-century Muslim mathematician. Not much is known about his life. The two records of him, one by Ibn Nadim and the other by al-Qifti are not identical. Al-Qifi mentions his name as ʿAbd al-Hamīd ibn Wase ibn Turk al-Jili. Jili means from Gilan. On the other hand, Ibn Nadim mentions his nisbah as khuttali (ختلی), which is a region located north of the Oxus and west of Badakhshan. In one of the two remaining manuscripts of his al-jabr wa al-muqabila, the recording of his nisbah is closer to al-Jili. David Pingree / Encyclopaedia Iranica states that he originally hailed from Khuttal or Gilan.
625	He authored a manuscript entitled Logical Necessities in Mixed Equations, which is very similar to al-Khwarzimi's Al-Jabr and was published at around the same time as, or even possibly earlier than, Al-Jabr.  The manuscript gives exactly the same geometric demonstration as is found in Al-Jabr, and in one case the same example as found in Al-Jabr, and even goes beyond Al-Jabr by giving a geometric proof that if the discriminant is negative then the quadratic equation has no solution. The similarity between these two works has led some historians to conclude that algebra may have been well developed by the time of al-Khwarizmi and 'Abd al-Hamid.
626	He seems to have specialized in monochrome ink drawings. Dust Muhammad recorded that `Abd al-Hayy's pupil, Ahmad Jalayir, contributed a black-and-white drawing to a manuscript of the Abusa`idnama ('Book of Abu Sa`id'), and a number of examples attributed to the late 14th century and preserved in various albums bear the notation that they were copied from `Abd al-Hayy's drawings by Muhammad ibn Mahmud Shah Khayyam. According to the Timurid chronicler Ibn `Arabshah (1392–1450), `Abd al-Hayy was a skilled painter who worked for Timur on wall paintings at Timurid palaces. The wall painting of the woman and child is similar to marginal drawings in a copy of Ahmad Jalayir's Divan, which have also been attributed to `Abd al-Hayy. According to Dust Mohammad, one of `Abd al-Hayy's students was Pir Ahmad Baghshimali.
627	During the 14 July Revolution, Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah was killed, along with most of the Royal Family. On 14 July 1958, a coup d'état led by Colonel Abd al-Karim Qasim toppled the government and brought an end to the Iraqi monarchy. The body of Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah was trailed on al Rashid street and was cut into pieces. According to the 21 July edition of Time magazine, Gamal Abdel Nasser's Middle East News Agency gleefully described the assassination of Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah: 'The people dragged 'Abd al-Ilah's body into the street like that of a dog and tore it limb from limb.' Then the mobs burned the body.
628	'Abd al-Rahman was one of a pioneering party of fifteen Muslims who emigrated to Abyssinia in 615. Other Muslims joined them later, forming a group of over a hundred. "They were safely ensconced there and grateful for the protection of the Negus; so they could worship Allah without fear, and the Negus had shown them kind gesture and warm hospitality as was foretold by the prophet even before they departed." In late 619 or early 620 "they heard that the Meccans had accepted Islam." This turned out not to be entirely  true, however a fair number of people did accept Islam as a result of the conversion of both Umar ibn Khattab and the prophet's own paternal uncle, the Lion himself, Hamza ibn Abdulmuttalib. 'Abd al-Rahman was one of forty who "set out for the homeland. But when they got near Mecca they learned that the report was false, so that they entered the town under the protection of a citizen or by stealth."
629	In August 626 Muhammad directed 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf to raid the Kalb tribe in Daumatul-Jandal, instructing him: “Take it, Ibn Awf; fight everyone in the way of Allah and kill those who disbelieve in Allah. Do not be deceitful with the spoil; do not be treacherous, nor mutilate, nor kill children. This is Allah's ordinance and the practice of His prophet among you.” Muhammad also instructed him on the correct way to wind a turban. 'Abd al-Rahman defeated the Kalbites and extracted from them their declaration of Islam and the payment of the jizya. He then sealed the alliance by marrying the chief's daughter Tamadur bint Al-Asbagh and bringing her back to Medina.
630	Many stories are told of 'Abd al-Rahman's personal generosity. He once furnished Muhammad's army with 1,500 camels. He bequeathed 400 dinars to the survivors of Badr and a large legacy to the widows of Muhammad. One day he brought a caravan of 700 merchant-camels into Medina. Aisha remarked, "I have heard Allah's Messenger say: 'I have seen 'Abd al-Rahman ibn Awf entering Paradise crawling.'" This was repeated to 'Abd al-Rahman, who replied: "If I could, I would certainly like to enter Paradise standing. I swear to you, yaa Ammah, that this entire caravan with all its merchandise, I will give in charity." And so he did.
631	Al-Hassani is noted for having written a book titled The Political History of Iraq (in the Arabic language), in which he considered the Hamrin Mountain Range as a natural border of Kurdistan. His approach towards this sensitive issue concerning the border created controversy about the ethnicity of Kirkuk city. Kirkuk is a multiethnic city in Iraq.  The ethnic identity of the city has been disputed among Kurds, Turkmen, Arabs, and Assyrians. This controversial approach was also supported in the past by many foreign researchers, including Cecil J. Edmonds in his book, "Kurds, Turks and Arabs. Politics, Travel and Research in North-eastern Iraq, 1919-1925", published by London: Oxford Press, 1957.
632	'Abdallah was a son of Ishaq ibn Muhammad, the ruler of the Balearic Islands from c. 1156 to 1183, and the brother of 'Ali ibn Ghaniya and Yahya ibn Ghaniya, who led a fifty-year long insurgency against the Almohads in the Maghreb. He accompanied his brother 'Ali when the latter set out from the Balearics and invaded North Africa in 1184, and upon the capture of Bajjaya (Bougie) that year he and Yahya were stationed in the town, remaining there until an Almohad counteroffensive forced them to flee approximately seven months later.
633	Following a pro-Almohad coup in the Balearics in c. 1185, in which the Almohad commander 'Ali ibn al-Reberter reinstalled Muhammad ibn Ishaq as amir, 'Abdallah was dispatched by his brother 'Ali to retake the islands and set out with a fleet from Tripoli. After stopping in Sicily, where he received reinforcements from the Norman king William II, he made his way to Majorca and linked up with loyalist forces headed by Najah, who had maintained a resistance against Ibn al-Reberter and Muhammad. The majority of the peasantry also rallied to 'Abdallah's side, and he was quickly able to secure control of Majorca and the surrounding islands.
634	Upon completing his conquest of Majorca, 'Abdallah remained in charge of the island, serving there as amir on behalf of his brother 'Ali. During his rule he maintained friendly relations with Peter II of Aragon and secured a peace and commercial treaty with the Republic of Genoa in 1188, allowing the latter to establish a church and hostel for foreign merchants on Majorca. He also resumed raiding activities, particularly against Provence and Almohad possessions in eastern al-Andalus, and continued assisting his brothers in the Maghreb, sending two ships to assist Yahya ibn Ghaniya when the latter besieged Tripoli in the 1190s.
635	'Abdallah's amirate came to an end in 1203, when the Almohads launched a major expedition to the Balearics against him. The Almohad forces, commanded by Abu al-'Ula and Abu Sa'id 'Uthman ibn Abi Hafs and consisting of 15,000 infantry, 700 archers, 1,200 cavalry, and several siege engines, encountered 'Abdallah's fleet at Menorca and destroyed it, after which they seized control of Menorca and proceeded to blockade Majorca. Although the capital was able to hold out for over two months, the defenders were eventually defeated and 'Abdallah himself was killed. The Balearic Islands were then turned into an Almohad possession, remaining in their hands until they were conquered by James I of Aragon in 1229.
636	The mosque can be found in the small ancient alleyways of Hamar Weyne and can be easily missed, as it is in the midst of houses. Maria Rosario La Lomia put forward the hypothesis that the mosque could have been built in the 13th century due to the similarities of the minaret of the 'Adayga to the minaret of Jama'a Xamar Weyne. The mosques name comes from the fact that you'd find a Salvadora persica tree which twigs is customarily used as a toothbrush, hence the name 'Adayga which in Somali means whitener or toothbrush. The mosque has recently been reconstructed again and has lost some of its features.
637	The son of Rukn al-Dawla, Fanna Khusraw was given the title of Adud al-Dawla by the Abbasid caliph in 948 when he was made emir of Fars after the death of his childless uncle Imad al-Dawla, after which Rukn al-Dawla became the senior emir of the Buyids. In 974 Adud al-Dawla was sent by his father to save his cousin Izz al-Dawla from a rebellion. After defeating the rebel forces, he claimed the emirate of Iraq for himself, and forced his cousin to abdicate. His father, however, became angered by this decision and restored Izz al-Dawla. After the death of Adud al-Dawla's father, his cousin rebelled against him, but was defeated. Adud al-Dawla became afterwards the sole ruler of the Buyid dynasty and assumed the ancient Iranian title of Shahanshah ("King of Kings").
638	In addition, 'Adud al-Dawla is credited with sponsoring and patronizing other scientific projects during his time. An observatory was built by his orders in Isfahan where Azophi worked. Al-Muqaddasi also reports that he ordered the construction of a great dam between Shiraz and Istakhr in 960. The dam irrigated some 300 villages in Fars province and became known as Band-e Amir (Dam of the emir). Among his other major constructions was the digging of the Haffar channel, that joined the Karun river to the Shatt al-Arab river (the confluence of the Tigris and the Euphrates). The port of Khorramshahr was built on the Haffar, at its junction with the Shatt al-Arab.
639	In 948, Fanna Khusraw was chosen by his uncle Imad al-Dawla as his successor because he had no heir. Imad al-Dawla died in December 949, and thus Fanna Khusraw became the new ruler of Fars. However, this appointment was not accepted by a group of Daylamite officers, who shortly rebelled against Fanna Khusraw. Rukn al-Dawla quickly left for southern Iran to save his son, and was joined by the vizier of Mu'izz al-Dawla for the same purpose. Together they defeated the rebels and put Fanna Khusraw on the throne in Shiraz. Fanna Khusraw then requested the title of "Taj al-Dawla" (Crown of the state) from the Abbasid caliph. However, to Mu'izz al-Dawla, the title of "Taj" ("crown") implied that Fanna Khusraw was the superior ruler of the Buyid Empire, provoking a reaction from him, and making him decline Fanna Khusraw's request. A more suitable title ("Adud al-Dawla") ("Pillar of the Abbasid dynasty") was instead chosen. Adud al-Dawla was only thirteen when he was crowned as the ruler of Fars, and was educated there by his tutor Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid.
640	After the death of Imad al-Dawla in 949, Adud al-Dawla's father Rukn al-Dawla, who was the most powerful of the Buyid rulers, claimed the title of senior emir, which Mu'izz al-Dawla and Adud al-Dawla recognized. In 955, a Daylamite military officer named Muhammad ibn Makan seized Isfahan from Rukn al-Dawla. Adud al-Dawla then marched towards the city and recaptured it from Muhammad ibn Makan. Another Daylamite military officer named Ruzbahan also shortly rebelled against Mu'izz al-Dawla, while his brother Bullaka rebelled against Adud al-Dawla at Shiraz. Abu 'l-Fadl ibn al-'Amid, however, managed to suppress the rebellion.
641	In the next year, Adud al-Dawla negotiated peace with the Saffarid ruler Khalaf ibn Ahmad, who agreed to recognize Buyid authority. In 969/970, Sulaiman, the son of Muhammad ibn Ilyas, wanted to regain his kingdom of Kerman, and invaded the region. Adud al-Dawla managed to defeat the army of Sulaiman and continued to expand his domains to the strait of Hormuz. During his campaign in southern Iran, many Iranian tribes converted to Islam and pledged allegiance to him. In August/September 971, Adud al-Dawla launched a punitive expedition against the Baloch tribes who had declared independence. Adud al-Dawla defeated them on January 8, 972, and installed loyal landowners to control the region. Afterwards, Adud al-Dawla and his father Rukn al-Dawla signed a peace treaty with the Samanids by paying them 150,000 dinars. In the same year, Adud al-Dawla conquered most of Oman, including its capital, Sohar.
642	In 974, Izz al-Dawla was trapped in Wasit by his troops who, under their leader, Sebük-Tegin, had rebelled against him. Adud al-Dawla quickly left Fars to quell the rebellion, where he inflicted a decisive defeat on the rebels on January 30, 975, who under their new leader, Alptakin, fled to Syria. Adud al-Dawla then forced Izz al-Dawla to abdicate in his favor on March 12, 975. Rukn al-Dawla, greatly angered at this action, complained to Adud al-Dawla that the line of Mu'izz al-Dawla could not be removed from power. Adud al-Dawla tried to make amends with his father by offering tribute to him, but Rukn al-Dawla rejected his offer, and then restored Izz al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq. The consequences of the restoration would later lead to war between Izz al-Dawla and Adud al-Dawla after Rukn al-Dawla's death.
643	Izz al-Dawla then stopped recognizing the rule of his cousin Adud al-Dawla, and stopped mentioning his name during Friday prayers. Adud al-Dawla, greatly outraged by his cousin, marched towards Khuzestan and easily defeated him in Ahvaz on July 1, 977. Izz al-Dawla then asked Adud al-Dawla for permission to retire and settle in Syria. However, on the road to Syria, Izz al-Dawla became convinced by Abu Taghlib, the Hamdanid ruler of Mosul, to go fight again against his cousin. On May 29, 978, Izz al-Dawla, along with Abu Taghlib, invaded the domains of Adud al-Dawla and fought against him near Samarra. Izz al-Dawla was once again defeated, and was captured and executed at the orders of Adud al-Dawla.
644	Adud al-Dawla then marched to Mosul and captured the city, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to the Byzantine city of Anzitene, where he asked for aid. Adud al-Dawla then spent one year in Mosul to consolidate his power, while his army was completing the conquest of Diyar Bakr and Diyar Mudar. The important Hamdanid city of Mayyafariqin was shortly captured by them, which forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Rahba from where he tried to negotiate peace with Adud al-Dawla. Unlike the rest of the Buyids who had held the region temporarily, Adud al-Dawla had complete control of the region during the rest of his reign.
645	Adud al-Dawla, now the ruler of Iraq, then took control of the territories under the control of the Bedouins and Kurds. He also killed almost all the sons of Hasanwayh, and appointed Badr ibn Hasanwayh, the last surviving son of Hasanwayh, as the ruler of the Hasanwayhid dynasty. It should be understood that during that period the word "Kurd" meant nomad. He then subdued the Shayban tribe, and fought against Hasan ibn 'Imran, the ruler of Batihah. He was, however, defeated, and made peace with Hasan who agreed to recognize his authority. During the same period, Adud al-Dawla had Izz al-Dawla's former vizier Ibn Baqiyya arrested, blinded, and then trampled to death by elephants. His corpse was thereafter impaled at the head of the bridge in Baghdad, where it would remain until Adud al-Dawla's death.
646	Adud al-Dawla then returned to Baghdad, where he built and restored several buildings in the city. He also stopped the quarrel between the Daylamites and Turks of the Buyid army. In 980, the Byzantine rebel Bardas Skleros fled to Mayyafariqin. When he arrived, he sent his brother to Baghdad to offer his allegiance to Adud al-Dawla and make an alliance against the Byzantines, which Adud al-Dawla accepted. A Byzantine envoy from Constantinople shortly arrived in Baghdad and tried to persuade Adud al-Dawla to hand over the rebel, but he refused, keeping the rebel and some of his family members in Baghdad for the rest of his reign, thus strengthening his diplomatic position with the Byzantines. In 981, Adud al-Dawla sent Abu Bakr Baqillani to Constantinople to negotiate peace. However, he was most likely sent to spy on the Byzantines and how their military functioned, since Adud al-Dawla was planning to invade Byzantine territory.
647	In 982, Adud al-Dawla sent another envoy to Constantinople, this time, Abu Ishaq ibn Shahram, who, after spending three months in the city, concluded a 10-year peace treaty with them. One year later, a Byzantine envoy arrived back in Baghdad, but Adud al-Dawla was too ill to bring an end to the negotiations. In the end, the 10-year peace treaty was finally completed, and the Byzantines also agreed to mention Adud al-Dawla's name in the Friday prayer in Constantinople. Sahib ibn Abbad is known to have said the following about this event: "he [Adud al-Dawla] has done what no kings of the Arabs nor any Chosroes [kings] of the Persians could – he has Syria and the two Iraqs, and he is close to the Despot of Byzantium and the Maghribi by his continuous correspondence."
648	Adud al-Dawla, in order to maintain peace, established marriage ties with several rulers: his daughter was married to the Abbasid caliph at-Ta'i, while another was married to the Samanids and the Ziyarid ruler Bisutun. Adud al-Dawla himself had several wives, which included the daughter of Bisutun; the daughter of Manadhar, a Justanid king; and the daughter of Siyahgil, a Giilite king. From these wives, Adud al-Dawla had several sons: Abu'l-Husain Ahmad and Abu Tahir Firuzshah, from the daughter of Manadhar; Abu Kalijar Marzuban, from the daughter of Siyahgil; and Shirdil Abu'l-Fawaris, from a Turkic concubine. Adud al-Dawla also had a younger son named Baha' al-Dawla. Abu'l-Husain Ahmad was supported by his mother and his uncle, Fuladh ibn Manadhar, as the heir to the Buyid Empire. However, Abu Kalijar Marzuban, because of his more prominent descent, was appointed as heir to the Buyid Empire by Adud al-Dawla.
649	Adud al-Dawla, like the previous Buyid rulers, maintained the Abbasids in Baghdad, which gave legitimacy to his dynasty in the eyes of some Sunni Muslims. However, he showed more interest than his predecessors to the pre-Islamic culture of Iran, and was proud of his Iranian origin. He visited Persepolis alongside Marasfand, the Zoroastrian chief priest (mobad) of Kazerun, who read the pre-Islamic inscriptions in the city for him. Adud al-Dawla later left an inscription in the city, which tells about his awareness of being heir of an ancient pre-Islamic civilization. Adud al-Dawla even claimed descent from the Sasanian king Bahram V Gor, minted coins of him wearing a Sasanian type crown, which carried the traditional Sasanian inscription, Shahanshah, may his glory increase. The reverse side of the coin said: May Shah Fanna Khusraw live long.
650	Like many of his contemporaries, he does not seem to have felt that his admiration for the pre-Islamic Iranian civilization conflicted with his Muslim Shiite faith. According to some accounts, he repaired the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala, and built a mausoleum of Ali in Najaf, which is today known as the Imam Ali Mosque. He is said to have been generous to a prominent Shiite theologian, but did not follow a Shiite religious policy and was tolerant to the Sunnis. He even tried to get closer to the Sunnis by giving his daughter in marriage to the caliph, which was a failure because the caliph refused to consummate the marriage.
651	The statues were formed by modelling moist plaster from limestone on a reed core using plants that grew along the banks of the Zarqa River. The reed decayed over the millennia, leaving plaster shells with a hollow interior. Lime plaster is formed by heating limestone to temperatures between 600 and 900 degrees celsius; the product, hydrated lime is then combined with water to make a dough, which was then modelled. Plaster becomes a water-resistant material when it dries and hardens. Heads, torsos and legs were formed from separate bundles of reeds which were then assembled and covered in plaster. The irises were outlined with bitumen and the heads were covered with some sort of wig.
652	They are comparatively tall, but not human-sized, the tallest statues having a height of close to 1 m. They are disproportionately flat, about 10 cm in thickness. They were nevertheless designed to stand up, probably anchored to the floor in enclosed areas and intended to be seen only from the front. The way the statues were made would not have permitted them to last long. And since they were buried in pristine condition it is possible that they were never on display for any extended period of time, but rather produced for the purpose of intentional burial.
653	The pit where the statues were found was carefully dug around, and the contents were placed in a wooden box filled with polyurethane foam for protection during shipping. The statues are made of plaster, which is fragile especially after being buried for so long. The first set of statues discovered at the site was sent to the Royal Archaeological Institute in Great Britain, while the second set, found a few years later, were sent to the Smithsonian Institution in New York for restoration work. The statues were returned to Jordan after their conservation and can be seen in the Jordan Museum.
654	Evidence of settlement at Mallaha or 'Ain Mallaha dates back to the Mesolithic period at circa 10,000 BCE. The first permanent village settlement of pre-agricultural times in Israel, Kathleen Kenyon describes the material remains found there as Natufian. The Natufian village was colonized in three phases. The first two phases had massive stone-built structures with smaller ones in the third phase. These phases occurred from 12,000 to 9600 BCE. The dwellings were cut into the earth, had subterranean floors, and walls that were built of dry stone. Wooden posts supported the roofs, which were probably thatches with brushwood or animal hides. Hearths were located within the dwellings. Kenyon describes the Natufian village as consisting of 50 circular, semi-subterranean, one-room huts, paved with flat slabs and surrounded by stone walls up to 1.2 meters (3.9 ft) high. The floors and walls of the homes were decorated in solid white or red, a simple and popular decorative motif in the Near East at the time.
655	The inhabitants of 'Ain Mallaha were sedentary hunter gatherers; it is likely that they lived in 'Ain Mallaha year round, gathering food from the surrounding wild stands of edible vegetation, and hunting local game. The inhabitants used hand mortars for grinding wild nuts and grain, and stone sickles for cutting plants from wild stands. Many of these sickle stones hold "sickle-gloss," indicating they had been used to cut large numbers of plant stems, most likely wild wheat and barley. The inhabitants are known to have eaten gazelle, fallow deer, wild boar, red and roe deer, hare, tortoise, reptiles, and fish.
656	It is likely that entire families were buried in the remains of their own houses, the houses being subsequently abandoned. During excavation, Perrot found one dwelling to contain the graves of 11 men, women, and children, many of them wearing elaborate decorations made from dentalium shells. In another dwelling (131), twelve individuals were found, one buried with her hand resting on the body of a small puppy. This burial of a human being with a domestic dog represents the earliest known archaeological evidence of dog domestication. One of the female burials has disarranged body parts and gazelle horn-cores placed near the head, David Wengrow has used this as evidence for the deep-history animal-human composites.
657	Most Ajam (both Sunni and Shia) resided in the Sharq historical district in the old Kuwait City, thereby forming a linguistic enclave which preserved the language for generations until the discovery of oil. They communicated in Persian between each other, and did not frequently mingle with Arabic speakers who resided in other districts of Kuwait City until after the industrialisation of Kuwait City which scattered people who lived in the districts of Kuwait City to the suburbs. The linguistic enclave was not present any longer therefore the Ajam had to learn Kuwaiti Arabic to survive in the new environment.
658	In the pre-oil era, Ajam introduced many new things to Kuwait. For instance, the first hotel in Kuwait in the later years of pre-oil era was built by Yusuf Behbehani; the first telephone in Kuwait was brought by M. Marafie; the first radio agency in Kuwait was established by M. Marafie in 1935; and the first refrigerator in Kuwait was imported by M. Marafie in 1934. Murad Behbehani was the first person to officially introduce television to Kuwait. He was the founder of Kuwait Television (KTV) before the company was nationalized by the government.
659	The majority of Kuwaitis from Failaka Island are of Iranian ancestry. They originally migrated to Failaka from the Iranian coast, mainly Kharg Island and Bandar Lengeh. These people are commonly known as the Huwala in the GCC states. They are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak Arabic fluently, although prior to the discovery of oil they also spoke Persian fluently. The most important Huwala settlement in Failaka Island pertained to 40 families who migrated from the Iranian island Kharg to Failaka in the years 1841-1842. The most recent settlement occurred in the early 1930s after the imposition of the unveiling law by Reza Shah. A minority of Failaka Island's Kuwaiti families are Shia Persians, they were noted as having their own hussainiyas and the older generations were frequent Arabic speakers, unlike the Kuwaiti Shia of Persian origin in mainland Kuwait City at the time.
660	The song is composed by Slaven Knezović, composer of No Name's "Zauvijek moja" and the lyrics are written by Milan Perić who also wrote lyrics for all previous songs that represented Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest ("Džuli" in 1983; "Ciao, amore" in 1984); as well as the Serbia and Montenegro entries ("Zauvijek moja" in 2005 and the disqualified entry "Moja ljubavi" in 2006). On March 12, 2007, the official video was released, filmed on many different locations such as Budva's old town, "Ćatovića Mlini" restaurant in Morinj, Ada Bojana.
661	Near 'Ajjur, at Khirbet Jannaba al-Fauqa, was a probable site of the Battle of Ajnadayn, waged in the 7th-century CE between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, and which resulted in a decisive Rashidun victory, incorporating most of Palestine into the domains of Islam. The village of 'Ajjur itself was built during early Fatimid rule in the region in the early twelfth century CE. A mosque was built during this period, and continued to serve 'Ajjur's community until its demise. The village 'Ajjur is believed to be named after "a sort of cucumber."
662	During this period, 'Ajjur became economically active in its vicinity. It held a Friday market or souk that attracted consumers and merchants from nearby towns and villages. A second school was founded in the village in 1934, which served students from nearby villages as well as from 'Ajjur. Like other Arab villages in Palestine at the time, 'Ajjur depended on agriculture, which was the basis of its economy. The main crops were olives and wheat. The second most important economic activity was animal husbandry, in particular, goat herding. Animal ownership was a symbol of social status and pride in the village, and residents gave affectionate names to certain types of animals. Animal herding caused seasonal movement by herders to distant dwellings from the village site, but still in its vicinity such as, Khirbet al-Sura and Khirbet al-'Ammuriyya. Shoe making, carpentry, and tanning were other common occupations in 'Ajjur.
663	In 1992, the Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi described the village: "Only three houses remain; two are deserted and one has been turned into a warehouse. One of the deserted houses is a two-storey stone structure that has a large, triple-arched front porch." Petersen, who inspected the place in 1994, noted "a large two-storey building with a vaulted arcade on the northern side. The upper part of the building is today used as a house whilst the lower part appears to be abandoned (although it remains locked). The arcade consists of three cross-vaulted bays resting on two free-standing piers and two engaged piers at either end. On the outer (north) face of each of the two central piers there is a stone carved with two rosettes which appears to be part of a classical entablature. The outer arches is emphasised by a flat hood moulding. Each bay is covered with a cross-vault which reaches a height of approximately 4m. [..] The upper floor is reached by an external staircase on the east side leading to a walled terrace above the arcade. [..] The identity or function of this building is not known although its design and orientation indicate that it may be a mosque." In 2000, Meron Benvenisti observed that: "Three large, beautiful structures, which were located outside the village amid orchards of fruit trees, have been renovated, and Jewish families live in them. In one, chamber music concerts are held."
664	The nearby Khirbet al-'Uqeiba was first excavated during the Mandate period, and was shown to contain remains such as building foundations, hewn stones, and wine presses. Cisterns, tombs, oil press and walls of ancient synagogue  have also been found. Foerster identifies the ruins as the  "early Galilean type" synagogue. Above the settlement, a 135 m high vertical cliff is located. There are one hundred and twenty-nine natural and man-made caves interconnected by passages in the cliff. According to tradition, those caves were used for shelter by Jews during their war with Romans. During archeological excavations, coins from Dor and Sepphoris were found in the caves, dating to the Roman emperor Trajan period.
665	Akbara/Akbari/Akbora/Akborin is mentioned several times in Rabbinic literature as early as second half of the third century CE. According to some traditions Rabbi Yannai disciplines lived in 'Akbara forming an agricultural community; R. Yannai established a bet midrash there. The earliest mention of this bet midrash is in the context of discussions between Rabbi Yohanan and sages of 'Akbara. According to Talmud school of Rabbi Jose bar Abin was also in Akbara.  Several of the rabbis mentioned in Pirkei Avot lived in 'Akbara. Akbara is mentioned as the burial place of several Talmudic sages: Rabbi Nehurai also Rabbi Yannai and Rabbi Dostai his son are buried "in the gardens" "by the spring".  According to tradition, the body of Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon was laying for twenty two years in his widow's garret in Akbara since he told her not to allow his colleagues to bury him. Rabbi Elazar ben Simeon feared to be dishonoured due to his aid to the Romans.
666	'Akbara, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517. Moshe Basola visited the village In 1522 and said that he had found there "destroyed synagogue, 3 cubits high remaining on two sides". Later in 1968 the remains of the synagogue were identified by Foester.  In the census of 1596 the village was part of the  nahiya ("subdistrict") of Jira, part of Liwa Safad, with a population of 36 households and 1 bachelor, all Muslims. It paid taxes on a number of crops and produce, including wheat, barley, summer crops,   olives, occasional revenues, goats,  beehives, and a press which was either used for processing grapes or olives; a total of 6,115 akçe. 6/24 of the revenue went to a waqf.
667	In 1838, it was noted as a village in the Safad district, while in 1875 Victor Guérin visited, and described it: "The ruins of Akbara cover a hillock whose slopes were formerly sustained by walls forming terraces; the threshing floors of an Arab village occupy the summit. Round these are grouped the remains of ancient constructions now overthrown.""The village lies on the east of the wady. It is dominated by a platform on which foundations can be traced of a rectangular enclosure called el Kuneiseh, measuring thirty paces in length by twenty-three in breadth. It stands east and west, and was firmly constructed of good cut stones. The interior is at present given up to cultivation. This enclosure seems to have been once a Christian church."
668	On 25 May 1948, during Operation Yiftah, under the command of Yigal Allon, Galilee was cleared of its Palestinian Arab population. The Palmach's First Battalion. Following the 25 May exodus of al-Khisas the last 55 villagers who had remained in their homes for just over a year were 'transferred' by Israeli forces despite having good relations and collaborating with Jewish settlements in the area. During the night of 5/6 June 1949, the village of al-Khisas was surrounded by trucks and the villagers were forced into the trucks ’with kicks, curses and maltreatment,’ in the words of a Mapam Knesset member, Elizer Peri, quoted by Morris: "The remaining villagers said that they had been ’forced with their hands to destroy their dwellings,’ and had been treated like ’cattle.’ They were then dumped on a bare, sun-scorched hillside near the village of ’Akbara [by then an abandoned Palestinian Arab village] where they were left ’wandering in the wilderness, thirsty and hungry.’ They lived there under inhuman conditions for years afterwards," along with the inhabitants of at least two other villages (Qaddita and al-Ja'una) expelled in similar circumstances. The expellees remained at ’Akbara for eighteen years until agreeing to resettlement in Wadi Hamam.
669	Of what remains of 'Akbara's built structures, Walid Khalidi wrote in 1992 that, "The original inhabitants of the village were replaced by "internal" refugees from Qaddita villages several kilometers north of Safad. Since 1980, however, these internal refugees have been gradually relocated to the nearby, planned village of 'Akbara, 0.5 km west of the old village site. As a precondition of the relocation, each family was required to demolish its home in the former village. Today, fifteen of the old houses still stand on the site, in addition to the school. The new village of 'Akbara was placed under the administration of the city of Safad in 1977. It is now a neighbourhood of the city of Safed.
670	'Akilotoa (subtitled Anthology 1994–2006) is the first greatest hits album by Australian vocal duo, Vika and Linda. The album is a two-disc, 28-track collection spanning 12 years from 1994 to 2006 and includes songs from five studio albums Vika and Linda, Princess Tabu, Two Wings, Love Is Mighty Close and Between Two Shores as well as live albums Live and Acoustic and Tell the Angels, a re-recorded version of "Down by the Jetty" and "Never Let Me Go" by The Black Sorrows. The album debuted at number 1 on the ARIA Charts, earning the duo their first number one album. In doing so, they became the first Australian sister duo to top the ARIA Albums Chart.
671	The title references their family heritage from Tonga. Vika Bull said "The title is pronounced exactly as it reads [and] it has lots of different meaning in Tongan. It actually means 'cascading' in the Tongan dictionary."About the album's release, the duo said "It's like a little stepping stone before we go into the next part of our career. It was always on the back burner. We had productive years and then there's been a bit of a gap. Before we do a new record we want to acknowledge the past and then we can move on. We are proud of it."
672	He was born in Bilad al-'Ajam (Persia was often called Bilad al-'Ajam [land of 'Ajam]) and educated in Bukhara, where he studied under Sa'd al-Din al-Taftazani. It was from him that al-Bukhari inherited a profound dislike for monistic philosophy, which he saw as synonymous with Ibn 'Arabi and his followers. Al-Bukhari traveled widely in Iran and Central Asia searching for competent religious. From an early age he excelled in traditional and rational sciences such as the Qur'an, hadith, rhetoric, logic, poetry, and dialectics. He also studied classical Sufi manuals and was seen by many as an accomplished Sufi master. A well-rounded individual with broad intellectual horizons, al-Bukhari for some time resided in India, where his preaching and lectures earned him great popularity among Indian Muslims. Having favorably impressed a local ruler, al-Bukhari was invited to serve as his personal religious tutor and advisor. However, a man of principle, he soon fell out with his Indian patron and left the Subcontinent for Mecca, where he lived for several years until the Mamluk sultan Bars Bay (r. 825/1422-841/1438) invited him to the Egyptian capital. Soon after his arrival, he was embroiled in a vociferous public dispute over Ibn 'Arabi's orthodoxy, in the course of which he clashed with the influential Maliki qadi of Egypt, Muhammad al-Bisati (d. 842/1438), who advised caution in this matter. Following a public altercation with his opponent, an angry al-Bukhari took ostentatious leave of Cairo to the great chagrin of his Egyptian partisans.
673	In Syria, where he settled after his departure, al-Bukhari kept thinking about his "humiliation" at the hands of al-Bisati and composed a lengthy refutation of Ibn 'Arabi and his school, titled "Fadihat al-Mulhidin wa Nasihat al-Muwahhidin" (Arabic: فاضحة الملحدين وناصحة الموحدين‎, lit. 'The Humiliation of the Heretics and Admonition of the Unitarians') Or, in another translation: (transl. The Dishonoring of the Infidels and the Counseling of the Champions of God's Oneness). Simultaneously, he got himself involved in another fierce controversy. Ironically, this time his target was Ibn 'Arabi's archenemy, Ibn Taymiyya, whom al-Bukhari accused of certain juridical "innovations." Al-Bukhari's critique caused a great uproar in Syria that was home to many influential followers of Ibn Taymiyya. Unmindful of the wide opposition to his critique among his Syrian colleagues, al-Bukhari boldly demanded that Ibn Taymiyya be divested of his honorific title of shaykh al-Islam, proclaiming everyone who refused to do so an unbeliever. His condemnation of Ibn Taymiyya drew severe criticism and eventually a book-size refutation by the Shafi'i scholar Ibn Nasir al-Din al-Dimashqi (d. 838/1434)27 who sent his opus to Egyptian scholars for approval. As one might expect, upon receipt of this work, Muhammad al-Bisati seized the opportunity to denounce his former prosecutor as an ignoramus and troublemaker. Al-Bukhari's acrimonious polemic with the Syrian supporters of Ibn Taymiyya did not cause him to forget about his hostility to Ibn 'Arabi, whom he continued to accuse of heresy and juridical incompetence.
674	The epithet "Khata'i" in ʿAli Akbar's name means "of China", presumably referring to him having traveled to and lived in China. While it is usually thought that at least some of the material in Khataynameh is based on the author's first hand experiences in China, at least one scholar of Khataynameh - Lin Yih-Min, who translated the book into modern Turkish - believes that ʿAlī Akbar (much like Juan González de Mendoza and perhaps Marco Polo) did not actually travel to China, and his work is thus completely based on others' reports.
675	ʿAlī Akbar's work, also known as Kanun-name,  was translated into Ottoman Turkish in 1582.  His work was used by later Turkish authors; in particular, it was one of the main sources of information on China used by Katip Çelebi in his Jihān-numā, along with an earlier work by a Ghiyāth al-dīn Naqqāsh. As modern researchers note, Ghiyāth al-dīn's and 'Ali Akbar's accounts, in a way, complemented each other, as the two authors saw Ming China from different aspects: Ghiyāth al-dīn came to the court of the Ming Yongle Emperor as a member of an official delegation from the Timurid ruler Shah Rukh, and much of his report is focused on court and diplomatic events; on the other hand, 'Ali Akbar, who, as Ildikó Bellér-Hann surmises, may have been a merchant, gives a much better view of the country's everyday life. Ali Akbar, in his book The Khataynameh, recorded many policies of the Ming court during Hongzhi and Zhengde reigns.
676	He was born in Ahvaz, southwestern Persia, and studied under Shaikh Abu Maher Musa ibn Sayyār. He was considered one of the three greatest physicians of the Eastern Caliphate of his time, and became physician to Emir 'Adud al-Daula Fana Khusraw of the Buwayhid dynasty, who ruled from 949 CE to 983 CE.  The Emir was a great patron of medicine, and founded a hospital at Shiraz in Persia, and in 981 the Al-Adudi Hospital in Baghdad, where al-Majusi worked. His ancestors were Zoroastrian (whence the nisba "al-Majusi"), but he himself was a Muslim. The name of his father was Abbas, and according to Iranica, is not the kind of name typically taken by a neophyte, a fact which suggests that conversion to Islam took place in the generation of his grandparents, if not earlier. He himself seems to have been lacking in Muslim zeal, since no mention is made of the prophet Moḥammad in his introductory remarks, while his argument for the excellence of medicine is based entirely on pragmatic reasoning without recourse to the Quran or the Sunna. Moreover, by calling himself "Ali b. Abbas Majusi", the author intentionally calls attention to his Zoroastrian background.
677	'Ali first came to power in Fars in 863, when the provincial army revolted under his leadership. Fars at the time was one of several provinces that had been assigned to the Tahirid family, who held the important governorships of Khurasan and Baghdad. In response to the revolt, the governor of Baghdad, Muhammad ibn 'Abdallah appointed his fellow Tahirid 'Abdallah ibn Ishaq as governor of Fars and sent him to pacify the province. When 'Abdallah arrived, 'Ali at first submitted to him and was assigned to fight against a group of Kharijites near the border with Kerman. Soon, however, the army became disgruntled with 'Abdallah, who refused to pay their salaries; as a result, 'Ali was able to convince the troops to support him in a new uprising. 'Ali returned and attacked 'Abdallah, forced him to retreat and seized his possessions. The army of Fars then made 'Ali their amir.
678	In 868, war broke out between 'Ali and the amir of Sistan, Ya'qub ibn al-Layth. According to al-Tabari, 'Ali had written to the caliph al-Mu'tazz and requested that the governorship of Kerman be given to him. Kerman, like Fars, had been assigned to the Tahirids, but 'Ali claimed that Tahirid misrule had weakened their control over the province. According to the narrative, the central authorities did not trust him, but agreed to appoint him as governor of Kerman. At the same time, however, they also wrote to Ya'qub and gave him the same appointment, in the hopes that the two amirs would fight against each other and that one of them would be defeated.
679	When 'Ali learned about Tawq's defeat, he feared that Ya'qub would press his advantage and invade Fars. He therefore mobilized his troops and set up his camp just outside Shiraz. When Ya'qub entered Fars, he and his army advanced to Shiraz and lined up to face 'Ali's forces. According to the biographer Ibn Khallikan, the resulting battle took place on April 21, 869; during the course of the fighting, Ya'qub's army broke through the enemy's front line, and soon 'Ali's men were abandoning the field in a panic and retreating back into Shiraz. 'Ali was captured and brought before Ya'qub, who ordered him bound and confiscated the possessions in his camp. Ya'qub then entered Shiraz and allowed his troops to plunder the residences of 'Ali and his partisans. After remaining there for a short time, Ya'qub abandoned Fars and returned to Sistan, and took with him 'Ali and a number of his commanders. Following Ya'qub's departure, the central authorities sent al-Harith ibn Sima al-Sharabi to govern Fars.
680	Malia Viviena 'Alisi Nunia Taumoepeau studied law in New Zealand, becoming the first Tongan woman with a degree in the subject. She had initially wanted to study medicine and mathematics but was not accepted for a scholarship. She turned to law at the suggestion of her father, Pousima 'Afeaki. Upon returning to Tonga she worked at the Crown Law Office for several years. By 2004 she had become solicitor general for the country. At the same time her husband 'Aisea Taumoepeau jointly held the posts of attorney general and Minister for Justice but was asked to resign. She was also pressured to resign by Prime Minister Fatafehi Tuʻipelehake, following her support of civil servants during a strike.
681	She was asked to resign her posts by the Tongan government, which she did effective May 31, 2009. Following her resignation her former role was split into two, with John Cauchi succeeding her as attorney general, and Samiu Vaipulu becoming the new Minister of Justice. At the time there was no official comment but it was later reported that it was after she mislead the Cabinet. Following the resignation of Cauchi from the attorney general post, she agreed with his allegations that both resignations were after the Cabinet interfered in the country's legal system.
682	'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! is the fourth studio album by Canadian post-rock band Godspeed You! Black Emperor, released on October 15, 2012 by Constellation Records, which was their first album since 2002's Yanqui U.X.O.. After reforming in 2010, the group went on tour and silently released the album at a concert in Boston on October 1, 2012, with official release dates on October 15 in Europe and the following day in other countries. The album received positive reviews and has been heralded as a comeback for the collective, winning the 2013 Polaris Music Prize.
683	'Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend! received positive reviews from critics. Eli Kleman of Sputnikmusic stated that the album has "immeasurable breadth and depth" and is a "truly unforgettable experience." Drowned in Sound's Andrzej Lukowski said that the release is "a modestly magnificent record that entirely validates" the band reforming. Mark Richardson of Pitchfork also draws a connection between the group's entire output, finishing his review by calling this "an album of music that is both new and old from a band that we thought we might never hear from again, one we should appreciate while we can." Tyler Kane of Paste gave the album an 8.9 out of 10, writing that, "the time-tested tracks not only showcase the band doing what they do best in notoriously long, dramatic, panic-inducing instrumentals but are also startling reminders on why the band was so vital and lead such a movement to begin with." The Guardian's Dom Lawson gave the album 5 out of 5 stars, because "the Godspeed ethos of wordlessly eliciting universal truths remains as devastatingly effective as ever".
684	The vinyl edition of the album packages the lengthier tracks "Mladic" and "We Drift Like Worried Fire" on a 12" LP accompanied by a 7" featuring the shorter, "drone" tracks "Their Helicopters' Sing" and "Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable". On the 12"'s inner sleeve there are instructions regarding which order the sides are to be played as this differs from most vinyl albums. The vinyl track listing is, in fact: A1 ("Mladic"), B1 ("Their Helicopters' Sing"), A2 ("We Drift Like Worried Fire") and B2 ("Strung Like Lights at Thee Printemps Erable"). The CD edition of the album compiles all four tracks on a single disc. "Mladic" and "We Drift Like Worried Fire" are re-workings of previously unreleased live tracks formerly known as "Albanian" and "Gamelan", which have been performed live as far back as 2003.
685	'Allo 'Allo! is a British sitcom television series created by David Croft and Jeremy Lloyd, starring Gorden Kaye, and originally broadcast on BBC One. The sitcom focuses on the life of a French café owner in Nouvion, during the German occupation of France in the Second World War, who has to deal with problems caused by a dishonest German officer, a local French Resistance leader, a stolen painting, and a pair of trapped British airmen, while concealing from his wife the secret affairs he is having with his waitresses. Croft and Lloyd devised the concept as a parody of BBC wartime drama Secret Army, and initially launched the programme with a pilot on 30 December 1982. The sitcom was eventually commissioned following the success of the pilot, and ran for nine series between 7 September 1984 until its conclusion on 14 December 1992. Both Lloyd and Croft wrote the scripts for the first six series, while the remainder were handled by Lloyd and Paul Adam.
686	Much like previous sitcoms created by Croft and Lloyd, the programme employed notable elements such as memorable catchphrases and ending credits, cultural clichés, physical humour and visual gags. However, 'Allo 'Allo! differed from these other sitcoms by featuring overarching plotlines rather than simple stand-alone stories, and the device of having actors speaking English but with theatrical foreign accents to distinguish each character's nationality. The sitcom proved popular with viewers and drew respectable ratings during its broadcast, with its success leading to it receiving stage show reproductions. A special entitled The Return of 'Allo 'Allo!, aired on 22 March 2007, featured a number of cast members returning to reprise their original roles to perform in a special story after the conclusion of the programme, alongside a documentary about the sitcom including a highlight reel of episodes, and interviews with the cast, production team and fans.
687	'Allo 'Allo! is set during the Second World War, between the occupation of France by German Axis powers in 1940 and its eventual liberation by Allied forces in July 1944. The story of the sitcom focuses on René Artois, a café owner in Nouvion and a reluctant member of the town's local French Resistance cell who operates under the codename of "Nighthawk". Because of the occupation of the town by German forces, led by the dictatorial Major-General Erich von Klinkerhoffen, René finds himself caught up between dealing with four problems – the scheme and plots of the town's corrupt commandant, Colonel Kurt von Strohm; the sabotage plans of the Resistance's leader Michelle Dubois; the efforts by Gestapo agent Herr Otto Flick to find a stolen painting and unmask Resistance members; and the love affairs with his waitresses, particularly Yvette Carte-Blanche, each of which he must conceal from both his wife Edith and each of the other waitresses.
688	Throughout the programme's broadcast, the sitcom features a number of overarching storylines, with two of these being the most prominent within episodes. The first, and most prominent plot, concerns the theft of a valuable painting from the town's chateau – The Fallen Madonna by fictional artist van Klomp (usually referred to as "The Fallen Madonna with the Big Boobies") – stolen by von Strohm, and the subsequent effort by him to conceal the theft from his superiors and Herr Flick. René is notably forced into handling the stolen painting out of threat of execution, but also due to being indebted to von Strohm for allowing him to fake his death when he is sentenced to execution for unjustified accusations of aiding the Resistance in an act of sabotage. The painting itself is subjected to being lost during the course of its concealment, before receiving a forged copy upon being found, only for it be lost again and sought out by not only by von Strohm, but also Herr Flick who, rather than return it to Berlin, intends to keep it himself.
689	The second storyline concerns the involvement of two stranded British airmen, shot down while over Nouvion. Because of their predicament, several plots in a number of episodes focus on the efforts of Michelle to devise plans that can help to send them back to England, with René not only forced to help hide them within his café or keep them under disguises, but also help in her schemes, sometimes devised by London who relay these plans via a radio installed within the bedroom of Edith's mother. Often, the schemes devised are so complicated, that they invariably backfire, especially when they collide with other schemes conducted by von Strohm and his assistants, leaving him, René and Michelle often worse off than before. Most other storylines concern various events that occur, including the efforts to remove von Klinkerhoffen's replacement from power, sabotaging the Germans' plan to invade England, and the subsequent build-up of German concern about an Allied invasion of France following the defeat of Italy.
690	Like previous sitcoms devised by the creators, 'Allo 'Allo! ends each episode with the caption "You have been watching (in order of appearance)", followed by a short vignette shot of actors who performed in the episode – whether as a main or supporting character – identified by their name in caption within each sequence. Although the shots appear like a clip from the episode, the production team conduct a separate filming session aimed as a reenactment of a scene the actor was involved in, mostly pertaining to a specific camera angle or action conducted by their character, with the vignette sequence often done in order of their first spoken line; the exception to this is that actor Gorden Kaye is always first in the sequence, regardless of when his first appearance is made.
691	As each episode builds on previous ones, viewers are often required to have followed the series to the episode they have reached in order to understand the plot. As 'Allo 'Allo! revolved around individual story arcs spread across several episodes, the creators opted for using a comical version of the "As you remember ..." device, commonly used in serials, to acts as a recap of events in the current story for the beginning of a new episode. This device within the sitcom was always conducted by René, who would open an episode by breaking the fourth wall (which Michael Bates did in It Ain't Half Hot Mum) to interact with the audience and provide a brief summary of events that had occurred previously, including notable events that had taken place, and also intermittently during episodes to make comic comments. The use of this plot device within the sitcom had considerable benefits for re-runs, as it allowed local TV stations who had reshuffled episodes for their schedule to ensure that their audiences could be aware of the plot events surrounding the story of the episode being broadcast.
692	One of the trickier problems with 'Allo 'Allo! was the fact that the main characters were of four different nationalities – French, German, English, and Italian.  Lloyd and Croft determined that it would be too much for the audience to follow multiple languages, so they employed a simple dramatic device to overcome the issue: all characters would speak English in a theatrical foreign accent depicting the foreign language.  French and German characters could understand each other when speaking, but the English characters could not understand the others without someone "translating" for them and vice versa.
693	Because of this device, each particular main language for the show required a specific accent and speaking style to be devised. While the French-speaking characters mainly spoke with a French accent, the English-speaking characters mostly employed Bertie Wooster-esque "top-hole, old chap!"-style banter in an upper-class English accent, and German speaking characters mainly spoke in a guttural manner. When Italian characters were added to the series, particularly Captain Alberto Bertorelli, in the fourth series, the cast members assigned to these role spoke in a nasal tone, making use of the letter "a" on the ends of certain words (i.e. "What a mistake-a to make-a!").
694	One of the more notable aspects of this device was in the speech of Officer Crabtree, introduced in the second series. Because his character was English with a poor grasp of French, the actor, Arthur Bostrom, spoke perfectly in the English style but mangled his words when speaking in the French style.  Bostrom therefore altered certain words in his sentences, substituting different vowels and/or consonants, changing them into different or nonsensical words, usually laden with innuendo. An example is the line "I was passing by the door, and I thought I would drop in.", which Bostrom pronounced "I was pissing by the door, and I thought I would drip in". Another example is Crabtree's greeting of "good morning", pronounced good moaning.
695	On 22 March 2007, a one-off special episode entitled The Return of 'Allo 'Allo! was filmed in Manchester, and was broadcast on 28 April 2007 at 9 pm on BBC 2. The storyline involves René writing his memoirs after the war, and the events from the final episode in 1992 have been overlooked. The new scenes were interspersed with clips from the original series and new interviews. The actors who reprised their roles were: Gorden Kaye, Vicki Michelle, Sue Hodge, Kirsten Cooke, Arthur Bostrom, Guy Siner, Robin Parkinson, John D. Collins and Nicholas Frankau. In addition, Richard Gibson and Sam Kelly are interviewed, although they are not reprising their respective roles. The only main characters who did not appear in the reunion at all (barring those cases where the actor or actress had died) were Private Helga Geerhart (played by Kim Hartman) and Herr Engelbert von Smallhausen (played by John Louis Mansi). Jeremy Lloyd wrote the new material.
696	The show's premise was not to make fun of the war but to spoof war-based film and TV dramas, and in particular a BBC1 drama Secret Army, which ran from 1977 to 1979 and dealt with the activities of a Belgian "escape line" that returned allied pilots to Britain, working from a Brussels café and later restaurant. Many of the elements and characters are directly taken from Secret Army, such as the café owner having an affair in the restaurant under the nose of his wife, a bed-ridden woman in a room above who knocks on the floor for attention, a pianist who is also the forger, and the enmity between the Gestapo and the German military. Many storylines for  'Allo 'Allo also derive directly from episodes of Secret Army, such as the valuable paintings and the accompanying forgeries, which both the Germans and the Resistance are seeking to obtain in the Secret Army second series episode "Weekend". Some actors from Secret Army also appear in 'Allo 'Allo!: Richard Marner, Guy Siner, John D. Collins, Hilary Minster and David Beckett. Inspiration was also drawn from patriotic black-and-white British melodramas of the 1940s.
697	Most popular was "Louise" from the film Innocents of Paris (1929), which featured a number of times and was even sung in the "broken-French" language of Crabtree, who pronounced the title "Loo-woes". Gruber sang a number such as "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" from Show Boat or "(I Got a Woman Crazy for Me) She's Funny That Way" by Neil Monet and Richard A. Whiting. He gazed at René in a slightly lustful manner, replacing lyrics such as "woman" and "she" with "boy" and "he". He caused a particular sensation with his straight version of Noël Coward's "Mad About the Boy".
698	In January 1990 Gorden Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car accident. As a result, his understudy, John Larson, played the part in a London Palladium production. Kaye had a dent in his forehead for the rest of his life from a piece of wood that smashed through the car window. He wanted to end the television show after his accident, but was persuaded by Jeremy Lloyd to continue. In Australia Gorden Kaye's part was played by Australian comedian/impressionist Max Gillies (later, Gorden Kaye repaid the favour when he took over Max Gillies' role in another play in Australia, when Max Gillies was unable to take part).
699	Between 1982 and 1987, and from 1989 to 1992, all interior scenes were filmed in front of a studio audience at the BBC Television Centre studios in London. For the fifth series, recorded from December 1987 to August 1988, production moved to BBC Elstree Centre in Studio D. With hopes for a US syndication deal, the BBC planned to make 26 new episodes of the sitcom; hence, a bigger space was needed for the production. Even though the US syndication deal did not go ahead as planned, production remained at BBC Elstree Centre for the remainder of the fifth series. With more space available, the outside set of Café Rene became a semi-permanent structure in the former ATV Garage building.
700	Series 5 is longer than any of the other series, and contains almost a third of the total number of episodes. The series was made with a view to airing the show in the US, so episodes were shortened to 25 minutes rather than 30 minutes to allow for commercial breaks; and twenty-six episodes were commissioned to tie in with the American tradition of having "seasons", rather than the typical British "series" of six to eight episodes. Due to these changes, two episodes were written by different writers; the director's role was shared between four people, the series was taped entirely in the studio (except the wedding scene of episode 6, which was shot on location in an actual church); and not all of the secondary characters appear in each of the series' episodes. Series 5 also sees the first appearances of the Communist Resistance girls Denise Laroque and Louise; and the last appearance of Jack Haig (who died in the time between the fifth and sixth series) as Monsieur Roger LeClerc.
701	Series 6 and subsequent episodes were 30 minutes in length, as they were not co-commissioned for the American market (as series 5 was). Jack Haig was originally meant to star in the series; but his death before the start of production prevented this. As the LeClerc character was important to the series, Derek Royle was brought in to play the part of Ernest LeClerc, Roger's brother. Naturally, the two characters are very similar in the roles that they play within the show's plot. The show also features the last appearance of Gavin Richards as Bertorelli who would be recast by Roger Kitter and Ernest would later be recast by Robin Parkinson.
702	There is a gap of fifteen months between the broadcasting dates of series 6 and 7. Gorden Kaye suffered serious head injuries in a car accident in January 1990; causing him to lose some of his memory. As Kaye was slow to make a full recovery, the whole show's future was in doubt. Even when the seventh series did come about, it brought some changes. David Croft left the series, with Paul Adam taking over the co-writing; Mike Stephens became the producer for the show; Robin Parkinson took over the role of Ernest LeClerc from Derek Royle, who had died in 1990; Roger Kitter replaced Gavin Richards as Bertorelli; and the series also saw the reappearance of Sam Kelly as Captain Hans Geering, though only for one episode.
703	Abū Naṣr ibn Mākūlā was a native of the village Ukbara on the Tigris north of Baghdād and the son of Hibat-Alāhā ibn Makula, vizier to the Buyid ruler of Baṣrah, Jalāl-al-dawla. He gained the title ‘al-Amīr’ (أمير), or ‘prince’, maybe in his own right, or in reference to his famous ancestor Abū Dulaf al-Ijlī.   His family had originally come from Jarbāzakān, between Hamadān and Isfahan in Irān, but his paternal uncle, was a muḥaddith (traditionist),  and qāḍī (chief justice) in Baghdād where Ibn Mākūlā began his studies. He continued his education by travelling to the regional centres of learning across Irāq, Khurāsān, Syria, Egypt, and Fars. In the last years of his life he held various official posts in the imperial administration of the Seljuk Empire, and once led an embassy to Bukhara to obtain the recognition of the new Abbāsid caliph Al-Muqtadi (1075-1094).One anecdote tells of a personal application made by Ibn Mākūlā on behalf of the grammarian Al-Akhfash the Younger, requesting a pension from the vizier Abū al-Ḥasan Alī ibn ‘Īsā.  This was angrily rejected it seems and the scholar was left in abject poverty. 
704	'Amran has a long history, dating back to the pre-Islamic era. During that period, it was one of the main centers of the Bakil tribal confederation. At the time of the Sabaean kingdom, the town blossomed into a fortress.  A series of bronze plaques from that time were found in the town in the mid-nineteenth century and are now in the British Museum.  In particular, in the seventh century it was the great city of valour during the clashes against the Sabeans, a plurality of regionally based tribes.  Remains of carved stones that belonged to former temples and palaces bear witness today of past glory. A large stone inscription is found in the western city gate (Bab al-Kabir).
705	'Anata (Arabic: عناتا‎) is a Palestinian town in the Jerusalem Governorate in the central West Bank, located four kilometers northeast of Jerusalem's Old City. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, 'Anata had a population of 9,600 in 2006. Its total land area is 30,603 dunams, of which over half now lies within the Israeli Jerusalem municipality and 1,654 is Palestinian built-up area. Since 1967, 'Anata has been occupied by Israel.  Together with Shu'afat refugee camp, the village is almost surrounded by the separation barrier, cutting it off from Jerusalem and surrounding villages except for a checkpoint in the west and a road in the north-east that gives access to the rest of the West Bank.
706	After the 1995 accords, about 3.8% of the land (or 918 dunams) is classified as being Area B, while the remaining 96.2 % (or 23,108 dunams) is Area C. Most of the lands of 'Anata have been confiscated by Israel. Of the 1877 dunums which remain in residents' hands, after creation of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, 957 dunums became part of Area B, 220 dunums part of Area C, and 700 dunums have been declared a closed military zone by the Israeli authorities. The Dahyat as-Salam neighbourhood has been annexed by Israel as part of the Jerusalem municipality. The village boundaries are far-reaching and stretch from 'Anata itself to just east of the Israeli settlement of Alon. Most of the land is undeveloped open space with little or no vegetation.
707	'Anata contains two sanctuaries, dedicated to Saleh and possibly Jeremiah. The former is a mosque dedicated to the prophet Saleh (Biblical Shelah), but Saleh's tomb is believed to be in the village of Nabi Salih to the northwest. The latter sanctuary is a cave dedicated to a "Rumia" which according to Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau, "looks as if it had been connected by the folklore with the name Jeremiah, the initial 'je' being removed by aphaeresis as so frequently happens in Arabic." This signifies that it is very possible that "Rumia" is an Arabicized form of "Jeremiah".
708	'Anin, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the  census of 1596 it was a part of the nahiya ("subdistrict") of  Sahil Atlit which was under the administration of the liwa ("district") of  Lajjun.  The village had a population of 16 households, all Muslim. The villagers  paid a fixed tax rate of 25%  on  wheat, barley, summer crops, olive trees, in addition to occasional revenues and a press for olive oil or grape syrup; a total of 3,600  akçe. Potsherds from the Ottoman era have also been found here.
709	'Aoa is a village on the north-east coast of Tutuila Island, American Samoa. It is located on the north coast, close to the island's eastern tip, at a narrowing of the island and is connected by road with Amouli on the south coast. Aoa is the oldest site on Tutuila to yield ceramics. Located in a large U-shaped valley on the northeast coast of the island, Aoa sits on a wide, sandy beach fronted by a large, deep bay. Fresh water is supplied by a steady river which runs through the village. It is located in Vaifanua County.
710	Over 40 ancient star mounds have been discovered in the bush near ‘Aoa. Village chiefs believe these elevated stone platforms were used in the ancient chiefly sport of pigeon-snaring. Archeologists believe they served as military lookouts due to their placement at strategic vantage points, perhaps as a military lookout for enemy canoes. Besides the star mounds, lepita pottery has been discovered in ‘Aoa. Some estimates date some of the potshards discovered here to 2000 BCE, while most of the scientific community dates them to 500 BCE. The Department of Tourism operated a camp site here complete with showers and barbecue facilities. The campsite was however closed as of 1994.
711	In 1942, Austrian immigrant to the U.S., Karl Paul Lippe, was billeted in the village of 'Aoa. He had joined the U.S. Marine Corps and was sent to the Samoan Islands. In the village of 'Aoa, Lippe was embraced by High Chief Logo, who asked him to move into his fale. Eventually, Lippe fell in love with Malele, the chief’s daughter. At the time the young Marine was called off to war, his wife was pregnant. After World War II, he made an attempt to visit American Samoa, but was told no one was allowed to settle in the islands without the Naval Governor’s permission. His request was initially denied but was later accepted when he managed to get in contact with the Chief of Naval Operations in Washington.
712	Ryholt's reconstruction of the name of 'Apepi is significant because five scarab seals inscribed with "King's son Apophis" are known. On two of these seals the inscription is furthermore enclosed in a cartouche and followed by di-ˁnḫ meaning "given life". These two attributes are normally reserved to kings or designated heirs to the throne and 'Apepi could be the Apophis referred to on the seals. Tentatively confirming this attribution, Ryholt notes that both scarabs can be dated on stylistic grounds to the 14th Dynasty, between the reigns of Sheshi and Yaqub-Har.
713	ʿArab al-Jahalin also known as al-Jabal (Arabic: عرب الجهالّين‎; Hebrew: ערב אל-ג'האלין‎) is a Palestinian Bedouin village in the Jerusalem Governorate, located five kilometers southeast of Jerusalem in the West Bank. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), ʿArab al-Jahalin had a population of approximately 1,205 inhabitants in mid-year 2006. The village is situated on a hillside outside al-Eizariya and 300 meters away from the Jerusalem Municipal dump. It is located in Area C of the West Bank. While the Israeli government has full control over the village, the populace hold Palestinian IDs.
714	In July 1994, the Israeli Civil Administration executed an eviction order relocating as number of residents to a site adjacent to a Jerusalem municipal garbage dump at Abu Dis, Throughout the 1990s there were 100-120 military or court orders for the eviction of al-Jahalin Bedouin. In 1997 and 1998, two further forcible expulsions of the Jahalin were implemented, with a further 1,050 relocated to Abu Dis. In the same year, an appeal resulted in a deal between the Israeli Civil Administration and representatives of 35 al-Jahalin families (about 200 individuals) who were permitted to "lease" what Israel considers to be state lands but which, according to the Jahalin themselves, belong to the local Palestinians of Abu Dis. With the founding of the village of ʿArab al-Jahalin, the relocated Bedouin complained that the allocated area deprived them of pasturage that might enable them to continue their traditional herding lifestyle, forcing 70% of the al-Jahalin to sell off their livestock. The area is also affected by a strong stench, caused by high quantities of methane gas, a process that will continue for at least two decades even after the proposed closure of the dump.
715	'Are'are was a single-member constituency of the Governing Council and Legislative Assembly of the Solomon Islands. Created in 1973 when the Governing Council was expanded from 17 to 24 seats, it was located on the island of Malaita. In the 1973 elections the seat was won by David Kausimae, who had been elected in the South Central Malaita constituency in the 1970 elections, defeating Peter Kenilorea. It was abolished in 1976 and succeeded by East 'Are'are (which was won by Kenilorea, who went on to be appointed the Islands' first Chief Minister) and West 'Are'are (in which Kausimae was elected).
716	The 'Are'are language is spoken by the 'Are'are people of the southern part of Malaita island, as well as nearby South Malaita Island and the eastern shore of Guadalcanal (the Marau Sound, 60 km away), in the Solomon Islands archipelago. It is spoken by about 18,000 people, making it the second-largest Oceanic language in the Solomons after the Kwara'ae (also spoken on Malaita). The literacy rate for 'Are'are is somewhere between 30% and 60% for first language speakers, and 25%–50% for second language learners. There are also translated Bible portions into the language from 1957 to 2008. 'Are'Are is just one of seventy-one languages spoken in the Solomon Islands. It is estimated that at least seven dialects of 'Are'Are exist. Some of the known dialects are Are, Aiaisii, Woo, I'iaa, Tarapaina, Mareho and Marau; however, the written resources on the difference between dialects are rare; with no technical written standard. There are only few resources on the vocabulary of the 'Are'Are language. A written standard has yet to be established, the only official document on the language being the 'Are'Are dictionary written by Peter Geerts, which however does not explain pronunciation, sound systems or the grammar of the language.
717	The 'Are'are are an ethnically Melanesian people that had up to 18,000 native speakers as of 1999 which was a steep increase from the 9,000 native speakers that were recorded in 1993 by John Houainamo Naitoro. According to census conducted by the Solomon Islands National Statistics Office, the total population of the islands rose from 285,176 in 1986 to 515,870 people in 2009. However, the 'Are'Are language does not encompass the entirety of the Islands. Rather, most of the speaker population is limited to the southern side of the Malaita island as well as the capital Honiara on the island of Guadalcanal. The speakers live as hunters and agriculturalists. They are traditionally a religious people and although they are mostly a Christian culture now, the 'Are still place a large importance on the connection between ancestors and the land around them. Burial grounds are viewed to be closely related both spiritually and in terms of "ancestral power". The culture of the 'Are'Are people is traditionally passed down orally through myths and other stories, which is why it has been difficult to keep record of all aspects of their beliefs and language. However, steps have been taken by the Wairokai Translation Committee to establish a written standard that can later be implemented into the 'Are'Are school curriculum.
718	The 'Are'Are people in the Solomon Islands place a large emphasis on music. In fact, most of the 'Are'Are people recognize at least 20 different musical types. The 'Are'are refer to musical instruments using the lexeme 'au, which has different meaning depending on the context used. At the root level 'au means "bamboo" which contrasts with other plants. For example, when one refers to a "tree" the word 'ai is used. Since the meaning of the lexeme au changes based on context, 'au might also mean "musical instruments (of bamboo)" depending the utilization of that specific product. Since words within the 'Are'Are language have such ambiguity it can often be difficult to translate the meaning completely accurately.
719	There is also a non-future and future distinction in negation. The non-future is negated with the preverbal particle ma, whereas the particle si is used for future negation. An example of this is used in the phrase Na=ma ma'asu which means "I didn't sleep". But in the phrase Na=si ma'asu, ma is replaced with si which now changes the meaning to "I will not sleep". In addition, active and stative verbal predicates will have the positive future is marked by the preverbal particle ka rao. For example, the phrase Na ma'asu means "I slept". However the similar phrase Na=ka rao ma'asu translates to "I will sleep". 
720	The ʿAsir Region is situated on a high plateau that receives more rainfall than the rest of the country and contains the country's highest peaks, which rise to almost 3,000 metres (9,800 ft) at Jabal Sawda near Abha. Though data is exceedingly sparse and unreliable, the average annual rainfall in the highlands probably ranges from 300 to 500 millimetres (12 to 20 in). It falls in two rainy seasons, the chief one being in March and April, with some rain in the summer. Temperatures are very extreme, with diurnal temperature ranges in the highlands the greatest in the world. It is common for afternoon temperatures to be over 30 °C (86 °F), yet mornings can be extremely frosty and fog can cut visibility to near zero percent. As a result, there is much more natural vegetation in ʿAsir than in any other part of Saudi Arabia, with sheltered areas even containing areas of dense coniferous forests, though more exposed ridges still are very dry.
721	In 25 B.C. Aelius Gallus marched his legions south from Egypt on a 1,300-mile expedition to take control of the ancient overland trade routes between the Mediterranean and what is now Hadhramaut in Yemen. The Romans wanted control of those routes because they were desperate for money and hoped to raise some by capturing Ma'rib, capital of Sabaʾ, and taking control of the trade in incense - then a priceless commodity - and other valuable aromatics. As it turned out, however, the expedition was a disaster and little information about ʿAsir emerged.
722	By 1920, however, Ibn Saud the founder of Saudi Arabia had begun to recoup the losses of the House of Saʿud and to unify most of the peninsula under his rule. As part of this campaign, he sent his Bedouin warriors also known as the Ikhwan to occupy ʿAsir, and from then on ʿAsir was controlled by the House of Saʿud - a situation formalized in 1934 with the signing of the Treaty of Taʾif between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Even then the region was still largely unknown to the West. In 1932, St John Philby, one of the first Europeans to explore and map the peninsula, did enter ʿAsir, but as he did not publish his observations until 1952, the area remained one of the blank spots on the world's map.
723	On the Dahrat Hamoud hill about 1.5 km south-west of 'Atara, standing at about 820 meters above sea level, lies the Maqam (shrine) of Sheikh al-Qatrawani. The shrine is one of a series of watchtowers overlooking the coast built by the Mamluks in the 16th century. The sanctuary, built atop the ruins of an ancient Byzantine monastery, is visited by Palestinian Muslims to offer vows and Christians to rest in or near. The present sanctuary is made up of the shrine, the remains of the monastery, a cave and a cistern.
724	The modern building is a renovated version of the original building built in the late Mamluk era in the 16th century. The renovation took place in 1999 undertaken by the Palestinian Department of Antiquities. The sanctuary is a rectangular building 9.8 meters in width, and 5.9 meters in length. It has two semi-spherical domes, measuring 3.8 and 3.9 meters in diameter respectively. The eastern dome is built of finely cut stones, while the western dome is built of small rough field-stones, but both kinds are of local origin. The northern wall is 85 centimeters thick and is constructed of small stones, mortar and rubble. The eastern room of the sanctuary contains a mihrab ("prayer niche") with the typical orientation to Mecca as required in Islamic doctrine.
725	The cistern, currently blocked, is in front of the shrine and most likely collected rainwater in the past for the sanctuary. It possibly also drew water from the nearby spring of Wadi as-Saqi, located two kilometers south of the site. To the west of the Sheikh al-Qatrawani sanctuary is a winepress cut through stone. Its basin is 1.8 meters deep and is coated with a layer of white plaster. A stone-cut cave is located in front of the shrine, but was blocked in 1984 by the residents of 'Atara for "safety reasons". In front of the building is a courtyard and the actual tomb of Sheikh al-Qatrawnani is located adjacently west of the site and has been plundered a number of times.
726	′Azza (Arabic: مخيم العزة‎; also spelled ′Azzeh, ′Azzah or Alazzeh) also known as Beit Jibrin Camp (Arabic: مخيم بيت جبرين‎) is a Palestinian refugee camp in the Bethlehem Governorate located within the city of Bethlehem. It is the smallest of the 59 refugee camps in the West Bank and the other Arab countries. It was established in 1950 on an area of 20 dunams (0.020 km2; 0.0077 sq mi) and receives services from UNRWA workers based in nearby Aida camp, but inside the camp there are no medical or educational services, so it was merged with the Aida camp to receive services.
727	Tough lumberjack Blue Blazes Rawden takes up residence at the hotel of the equally tough Englishman, Ladyfingers Hilgard. Because Blue Blazes beats him at cards and steals the heart of his woman, Babette Du Fresne, Hilgard challenges Blue Blazes to a gunfight and is killed. Hilgard's mother and brother Eric soon visit the hotel, and Blue Blazes, touched by Mrs. Hilgard's gentle nature, tells her Hilgard died honorably. Babette, angry at Blue Blazes' inattention, tells Eric the truth, and Eric, enraged, shoots and seriously wounds Blue Blazes. After saving Eric from a lynch mob, Blue Blazes makes him promise never to tell Mrs. Hilgard what he knows and leaves town a reformed man.
728	Hart published a letter in the Motion Picture News (March 30, 1918), titled A straight-from-the shoulder letter, advising exhibitors that he was not connected with a company called "W.H. Productions Co.". Hart claimed that the company was changing titles of his films and showing previously made features of him without his permission. The letter states that "the old titles under which they were previously exhibited have been changed and new titles substituted...they are old pictures with new labels". Hart went on to say that, "if your patrons...are misled by new titles into a belief that these pictures are my latest productions, it will not only injure my reputation but also seriously affect the reputation of your theatre". Blue Blazes Rawden is listed at the bottom of the letter, along with his other films that bear the "Artcraft" trademark.
729	A reviewer in Photoplay (1918) said that "Hart gives the best exhibition of his acting ability that I have ever yet seen". They also noted that the story "has no actual ending", but rather "is something of a slice of life...its interest lies in the struggle that goes on in the heart of the naturally ferocious, brutal Rawden, turned gentle by sheer determination". A review in Variety (1918) praised Hart saying, "[he] was a good actor long before he thought of going into pictures... he now reveals one more artistic accomplishment - that of an intelligent, careful, painstaking director. The detail in the preparation of the feature goes a long way toward enhancing its value". The Motion Picture Magazine (1918), said that "one celluloidic thing is as inevitable as fates and taxes-that William S. Hart starts each new picture career as a bad man and ends it by being completely reformed... like the excess tax, it is an excess reformation".
730	'Bout It is the second studio album by American singer Jesse Powell. It was released by Silas Records on September 8, 1998 in the United States. It was Powell's first album to chart on the US Billboard 200, peaking at number 63. For sales in excess of 500,000 copies, 'Bout It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 8, 1999. Three singles were released from the album, including "I Wasn't with It", "You" and "'Bout It, 'Bout It". "You" is Powell's only hit to date on the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number 10 in 1999.
731	Kevin Parker described the song as being "about how weak men are basically, and how we make all these excuses." In the song, Parker's vocals are clearer in the mix than in previous Tame Impala songs, an extension of his love of "that dreamy, silvery vocal sound." It was difficult for him, as he was uncomfortable with his vocal performance. According to Parker, recording the song became obsessive. He recalled performing over 1,057 partial vocal takes for either "'Cause I'm a Man" or the album's fourth single, "The Less I Know the Better", though he could not recall which.
732	The song received two music videos. The first "official" music video for the song, lasting four minutes and four seconds, was uploaded on 21 May 2015 to the group's Vevo channel on YouTube. The video is a 3D animation centered on a man with no face and his events in life involving work, women, and "the ultimate pitfalls of life", as stated by AXS TV. It was directed by Nicky Smith. The second, directed by Dan Dipaola and Megan McShane, features puppet versions of Tame Impala performing the song, and was released on 28 May. In June, Feltworth, a puppet band connected with the Canadian group Sloan, released a clip wherein its members debate the merits of the second clip.
733	"'Coz I'm Free" is a song recorded by Christine Anu. It was released in April 2001 as the third and final single from her gold-selling, second studio album, Come My Way (2000). The song is inspired by Anu's hero Cathy Freeman. At a Mushroom Records press release, Anu said; "I met Cathy at the ARIA Music Awards a couple of years ago but it wasn’t until I saw her in Seville... that "‘Coz I’m Free" came together. I watched her win the World Championships and then we caught up in London not long afterwards.... She's so inspiring—her focus, how hard she trains, all that she's achieved. When I watched the race in Seville, the camera zoomed in on her tattoo and I got the idea then for a song." The song peaked at number 86 on the ARIA Chart.
734	"Disco La Passione" is a 1996 song by British singer-songwriter Chris Rea. The song was written for the film La Passione, a semi-autobiography by Rea. Shirley Bassey made her feature film debut here, but the film was a disappointment at the box office. A single was issued, produced by Rea and, unusual for Bassey, credited as co-performer.  The track also appears on the soundtrack album La Passione. The single sold well in Europe, making the Top 40 of the Dutch and Belgian charts, but just missed being a Top 40 hit on the UK Singles Chart, charting at #41.
735	The double fish hook involves a string of port developments and alliances that India has entered into. The first fish hook covers the eastern Indian Ocean and begins in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and ends at the US military base (Diego Garcia) in the Chagos Archipelago. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands constitute the endpoint of the US fish hook strategy. The western fish hook begins at the Duqm port through India's Maritime Transport Agreement with Oman and traverses Mauritius, Seychelles, and Madagascar. India also develops maritime linkages with France, which has security interests for its territories in the Indian Ocean region.
736	This cultivar is a hybrid between two mandarins (King x Willowleaf), obtained by H.B.Frost, in California. It began to be commercialized from 1965.It is cultivated in Japan, in greenhouses. In Portugal, its area has increased due to the high prices of the fruits, but at the moment it is stabilized or diminishing.The tree has a characteristic aspect, given by the branches that form an acute angle with the central axis of the tree, without observing pending branches.The fruit is of excellent internal quality, although its vitamin C content is relatively low when compared to an orange. Each fruit can contain 25 or more seeds. In some orchards, the number of seeds is reduced.It has a great tendency to alternate bearing. In the year of high harvest presents low levels of potassium. The fruit can even kill the branches because it is a very strong (the strongest) sink.Sometimes fruit present peel pitting, which is a problem for its commercialization, especially in markets where this fruit is not known. There are orchards where no pitting appear until harvest, or peel pitting is not notorious.
737	The Gay Liberation' Monument is a monument featuring the sculpture 'Gay Liberation' by American artist George Segal, located in Christopher Park along Christopher Street in the West Village section of Manhattan, New York. The monument was completed in 1980 and was notably the first piece of public art dedicated to LGBTQIA+ rights and displaying solidarity for LGBTQIA+ individuals, while simultaneously commemorating the ongoing struggles of the community. Located at the northern end of the park, the  installation commemorates the Stonewall Riots; the monument was dedicated on June 23, 1992, and is part of the Stonewall National Monument.The sculpture itself features two pairs of life-like, life-size individuals made of bronze and painted white; the monument depicts a standing couple (two men) and a seated couple (two women).
738	The Stonewall Riots on Christopher Street in the year 1969 are widely remembered and commemorated as a watershed event in the movement for LGBTQIA+ liberation in New York City. In the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969, police forces raided the Stonewall Inn, located in Greenwich Village in New York City and began demanding to see the identification documents of patrons. Many (transgender, gender-nonbinary, gender-nonconforming) patrons were hesitant to display their identification to police officers, particularly if their identification documents provided outdated information related to their gender identity and/or sex assigned at birth. Accordingly, many patrons verbally and physically expressed their discomfort with their being forced to disclose their identities; a number of patrons were asked to leave the bar, and an agitated crowd of patrons and officers alike began to congregate on the nearby sidewalks. The crowd included LGBTQIA+ individuals of all ages, genders, races and ethnicities, as well as a number of straight allies. Protestors were shouting at the police and physically fending them off of the individuals who were either handcuffed or being held in police vehicles. A number of individuals in the crowd threw bricks, coins and bottles at the windows of the Stonewall Inn, shattering them; some protesters tried to break down the front door with an uprooted parking meter, and others tried to set fire to the Inn. Over the next few hours, as well as throughout the following week, thousands of people rioted in the nearby streets in solidarity with the LGBTQIA+ community that had been victimized in the early morning hours of June 28th, 1969.
739	The original plan for Segal’s commission (which was introduced on the tenth anniversary of the Stonewall Riots) was to create two separate castings of ‘Gay Liberation’ and to place one of them in Christopher Park in Greenwich Village, New York City, and to place the other casting in Los Angeles. Although many legislators and city organizations endorsed its commission in Greenwich Village, many local residents opposed the plans for the monument’s installation. Ultimately, New York City failed to allocate the funding necessary to complete the project. The casting that had been created for placement in Los Angeles also was not ultimately displayed because the local governing body did not approve of the work, so the project was made to be fulfilled and displayed on the campus of Stanford University in San Francisco, California, in 1984.
740	A significant number of activists who contributed heavily to the riots were individuals of Color, and/or individuals of diverse gender identities, identifying as transgender, gender-nonconforming, and/or gender-nonbinary; two prominent examples of such individuals include Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Marsha P. (“Pay It No Mind”) Johnson was a Black trans woman, and Sylvia Rivera was a trans woman of Puerto Rican descent; both women were prominent figures in the Stonewall Riots and are often rumored to have thrown the first bricks and bottles of the Riots. Johnson and Rivera both participated in ongoing advocacy efforts to improve conditions for LGBTQIA+ youth, particularly trans and homeless youth, in the New York City area.
741	Moreover,  some historical accounts attest the ignition of the Riots to a lesbian’s physical and verbal conflict due to maltreatment by police officers. At the Inn, a lesbian woman dressed in traditionally-masculine clothing was arrested for not wearing pieces of clothing that were “correct for her gender”; she physically fought back against numerous police officers who were excessively forceful with her and/or touched her inappropriately. Her head eventually began bleeding profusely from having been hit with a club by the police officers, and as she was being shoved into the van against her will, she screamed to a group of bystanding gay men, “Why don’t you guys do something?!”. This altercation apparently led to the further erupting physical conflicts of the Stonewall Riots.
742	Highlighting the individuals of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and diverse gender identities is necessary in analyzing the memorialization of the Stonewall Riots today. There were certain demographics of individuals who played pivotal roles in the Riots (i.e., racial/ethnic minorities and/or gender minorities) who faced far more discrimination and police brutality due to their race and gender, than did their white and/or cisgender counterparts. Because of this, it can be seen as unfitting for a notable monument commemorating the Riots, to depict individuals who may not have faced as severe discrimination at the Riots, when a number of people of Color and diverse gender identities played such integral roles in their facilitation.
743	In acknowledging the intersectional history of the LGBQTIA+ liberation movement, specifically in New York City, sociologists, anthropologists and historians have examined the nuances of performativity that relate to the 'Gay Liberation' monument in Christopher Park, in order to investigate whether this monument is serving its purpose as a widely-recognized beacon of queer freedom. Sociologists and anthropologists have considered the notion(s) of the thinker Henri Lefebvre, that representations of space are profoundly influenced by ideas associated with societal systems and institutions, and that representations of space can and should be fluid and open to modification. Lefebvre (1991) depicts the nuances of the utilization of space, asserting that representations of space are utterly relational and depict fluid progressions throughout society; Lefebvre argues that productions of space have been “colonized” by concrete and stagnant representations that “impose an image” and thereby establish and regulate the commemoration and memorialization of a historical moment or phenomenon. This concept, as related to the idealized depiction of the two homosexual couples in Segal’s ‘Gay Liberation’, invites the question whether this monument accurately represents the diverse communities that spearheaded the fight for queer liberation. 
744	Social theorists, anthropologists, rhetoricians and individuals within the LGBTQIA+ community have questioned whether the quiet, peaceful ‘Gay Liberation’ monument adequately pays homage to the unabashed and revolutionary historical accounts of the Stonewall Riots. The concept of accurately memorializing a violent uprising that was led on the basis of individuals’ rights to exist in society, is intricate and multifaceted. As stated by Genevieve Flavelle in C Magazine, “Why does the ‘Gay Liberation’ monument (1980), a George Segal commission for the 10th anniversary of the Riots, depict four figures quietly socializing in Christopher Park instead of scores of drag queens throwing high heels and ripping parking meters out of the ground?” The docile nature of Segal’s ‘Gay Liberation’ presents a contrast to the nature of Stonewall itself, as the uprising was ignited and exacerbated by the sweeping actions of individuals of diverse races/ethnicities, and/or diverse gender identities.  
745	Artistic curators and social theorists have examined the nature of the Stonewall Riots, and the LGBTQIA+ Liberation Movement in general, as a constant and ongoing fight to affirm the identities and preserve the basic liberties of existence of LGBTQIA+ individuals. The Stonewall Riots were spearheaded by LGBTQIA+ individuals (particularly lesbians; transgender, gender-nonbinary and gender-nonconforming individuals) of diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds and ability statuses. It is necessary to understand and acknowledge that many of the individuals (and their respective communities/demographics) who protested at Stonewall, did not achieve liberation from the intersecting oppressive systems of homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism and ableism; the fight for LGBTQIA+ liberation is far from over, and only proliferates and widens as LGBTQIA+ individuals of diverse intersecting identities are continually victimized, targeted and stigmatized in society.
746	The Stonewall Riots have been portrayed in diverse manners in various narratives and monuments. Chris E. Vargas, the executive director of the MOTHA, the Museum of Transgender Hirstory and Art, discusses the importance of narrating the Stonewall Riots with a sense of progress and evolution that the movement for LGBTQIA+ liberation continues to undertake. Vargas states that Segal's 'Gay Liberation' may not encompass the multilayered history of the Stonewall Riots, particularly because the Riots were centered around anti-establishment politics. Vargas grapples with the memorialization of the Stonewall Riots in general, because conceptualizing a movement in a singular monument may lead the ever-evolving movement to become "...safely placed in the past, and all the concerns of the people involved in the riots are resolved in a clean and tidy way."
747	Within a demographic that has been historically misrepresented and heavily stereotyped, the oral histories and/or verbal narratives of individuals are valuable in depicting and honoring a collective historical narrative. Individuals within the LGBTQIA+ community have been excluded from historical archives, primary and secondary accounts, anthropological research and scholastic conversations until recent decades. Additionally, many of the lived experiences of LGBTQIA+ individuals of past generations have gone untold for a number of reasons, including the fact that many these individuals were lost to the AIDS Crisis, committed suicide due to a lack of social support, and/or were forced to live in the closet in order to preserve their safety. Accordingly, researchers rely heavily on the oral histories of queer and trans individuals in order to conceptualize historical events. The difficulty in utilizing oral histories to research, commemorate and memorialize queer and trans experiences is that these specific historical events are conceptualized differently on a person-to-person basis, aside from the fact that so many oral histories have been stifled or gone untold.
748	The utilization of oral histories plays a significant role in representing the experiences of a community in a manner that is accurate and all-encompassing, which relates to the memorialization of the queer experience of the Stonewall Riots in Segal’s ‘Gay Liberation’ monument. Researchers’ reliance on oral histories and narratives to understand and conceptualize the Stonewall Riots also relates to the concept that it is difficult to encapsulate such a history in one stagnant monument, as the history itself is ongoing and frequently evolving as more information is uncovered and as the movement for queer liberation widens and embraces different intersecting identities.
749	One interpretation of the design and spatial layout of Segal's ‘Gay Liberation’ is that his depiction of the gay and lesbian couples was to normalize homosexual relationships by reflecting them in a domestic light, rather than portraying homosexual relationships in the ostentatious, sensationalized and hyper-sexualized manners that are common in popular media. Simultaneously, the subjects of Segal’s monument are portrayed and depicted with physical elements that serve to shed light upon the complexity of their relationships; both couples are exhibited locking eyes, which may be interpreted as symbolizing commitment and communion, which are aspects of same-sex relationships that are unduly excluded from their depictions in popular culture and media. Segal has apparently remarked that his sculpture tends to concentrate “...on tenderness, gentleness and sensitivity as expressed in gesture”, which allows the viewer to appreciate the intimacy of the partners’ relationships.
750	Individuals have continuously questioned the decision to place the monument in Christopher Park, and have analyzed and scrutinized the concept of Christopher Park as a space for queer existence and expression. Christopher Park is geographically located directly across from the Stonewall Inn, thus Christopher Park has been at the center of the LGBTQIA+ liberation movement of New York City since the Stonewall Riots in 1969. In the year 1999, the site of the Stonewall Uprising, and the surrounding neighborhood streets in the proximity of Christopher Park, were placed on the New York State Register of Historic Places and added to the National Register. Consequently, Christopher Park is, socially and historically, viewed as a space wherein LGBTQIA+ people exist, and do so openly; Segal’s ultimate decision to make this monument appear as innocuous as possible, and to place it in a space wherein it would, theoretically, be well-received, suggests that this decision may have been impacted by societal pressures to restrict the commemoration of queer history solely to designated queer spaces.
751	The "Me" is what is learned in interaction with others and (more generally) with the environment: other people's attitudes, once internalized in the self, constitute the Me. This includes both knowledge about that environment (including society), but also about who the person is: their sense of self. "What the individual is for himself is not something that he invented. It is what his significant others have come to ...treat him as being." This is because people learn to see who they are (man or woman, old or young, etc.) by observing the responses of others to themselves or their actions. If others respond to a person as (for instance) a woman, the person develops a sense of herself indeed as a woman.
752	At the same time, 'the "Me" disciplines the "I" by holding it back from breaking the law of the community'. It is thus very close to the way in a man Freud's 'ego-censor, the conscience...arose from the critical influence of his parents (conveyed to him by the medium of the voice), to whom were added, as time went on, those who trained and taught him and the innumerable and indefinable host of all the other people in his environment—his fellow-men—and public opinion'. It is 'the attitude of the other in one's own organism, as controlling the thing that he is going to do'.
753	By contrast, 'the "I" is the response of the individual to the attitude of the community'. The "I" acts creatively, though within the context of the me. Mead notes that "It is only after we have acted that we know what we have done...what we have said." People, he argues, are not automatons; Mead states that "the "I" reacts to the self which arises though the taking of the attitude of others." They do not blindly follow rules. They construct a response on the basis of what they have learned, the "me". Mead highlighted accordingly those values that attach particularly to the "I" rather than to the me, "...which cannot be calculated and which involve a reconstruction of the society, and so of the 'me' which belongs to that society." Taken together, the "I" and the "me" form the person or the self in Mead's social philosophy. According to Mead, there would be no possibility of personality without both the "I" and the "Me".
754	When there is a predominance of the "me" in the personality, 'we speak of a person as a conventional individual; his ideas are exactly the same as those of his neighbours; he is hardly more than a "me" under the circumstances'—"...the shallow, brittle, conformist kind of personality..." that is "all persona, with its excessive concern for what people think." The alternative—and in many ways Mead's ideal—was the person who has a definite personality, who replies to the organized attitude in a way that makes a significant difference. With such a person, the I is the most important phase of the experience.
755	There is a villain (Charles Brinley), who's after Jim Golden's (Harry Carey) gold, and a nice post mistress (Carol Holloway), who is willing to become both wife and mother. Universal surrounded their veteran western star, Harry Carey, with a fine supporting cast in this film, including former serial queen Carol Holloway as the post mistress, rotund comedy actor George Bunny, and one Minnie Prevost, a Native American supporting player who was billed as "Minnie Ha Ha" and had made an indelible impression with Mabel Normand in the 1918 film Mickey.
756	'Imran created the marsh state during the period of the declining authority of the Caliphate. Having committed a crime in Jamidah, 'Imran fled to the neighboring swamps to avoid punishment by the local government. From there he managed to gain the cooperation of fellow criminals and local fisherman, and was able to set up a robber state, defying government authority. He managed to expand his power when the Biridis of Basra charged him with the protection of Jamidah and the parts of Ahvaz lying within the Batihah. With more followers flocking to him, 'Imran was eventually able to take control of the whole swamp.
757	Ruzbahan, who disliked the vizier, convinced him to directly attack 'Imran. He kept his forces in the rear and fled as soon as fighting between the two sides began. 'Imran used the terrain effectively, laying ambushes and confusing al-Muhallabi's army. Many of the vizier's soldiers died in the fighting and he himself only narrowly escaped capture, swimming to safety. Mu'izz al-Daula then came to terms with 'Imran, acceding to his terms. Prisoners were exchanged and 'Imran was made a vassal of the Buyids, being instated as governor of the Batihah.
758	Peace lasted for approximately five years between the two sides. A false rumor of Mu'izz al-Daula's death in 955, however, prompted 'Imran to seize a Buyid convoy traveling from Ahvaz to Baghdad. Mu'izz demanded that the items confiscated be returned, at which point 'Imran returned the money gained, but kept the goods taken. The Buyid sent Ruzbahan a third time to the swamp, but the latter revolted and 'Imran was spared from a new attack. He remained secure for twelve years; only in 967 was another campaign launched against him. Mu'izz al-Daula oversaw the expedition himself, but he became sick and ultimately died, preventing any progress from being made. His son and successor, 'Izz al-Daula, quickly sent the Turkish general Sebük-Tegin to make peace with him.
759	War between the two sides resumed in the summer 971, when 'Izz al-Daula's vizier Abu'l-Fadl suggested carrying out an attack against the Batihah in an effort to plunder the robber-state and relieve the Buyids' financial troubles. He dammed all the waterways leading into the marshes in order to destroy 'Imran's advantage, and built a dyke that allowed his troops to march up to 'Imram's capital fortress. 'Imran, however, sent his men out when the waters rose to destroy the dams, and if they could not do that he would simply move himself to another location in the marshes. As a result of the slow progress of the campaign, the Buyid troops lost morale and became mutinous. This, coupled with an invasion by the Byzantine Empire, forced 'Izz al-Daula to make peace with 'Imran. The latter greatly benefited from the terms, without any obligation for tribute.
760	Mosothoane was born in Kanye, Botswana, into a Tswana family. Her native language was Setswana. Mosothoane attended secondary school in Gaborone (Botswana's capital), and subsequently completed a diploma in nursing, interning at Gaborone's Princess Marina Hospital. She moved to Lesotho to study at the National University of Lesotho, graduating in 1982 with a Bachelor of Arts in Education. Remaining in Lesotho after graduation, Mosothoane initially worked as a high school teacher, teaching at schools in Linare and Hlotse. In 1987, she began working at the English-medium school for the Leribe District, where she became principal in 1991. Outside of her work in education, Mosothoane was elected president of the Lesotho Red Cross Society in 2003.
761	At the 2012 Lesotho general election, Mosothoane was elected to the National Assembly as a Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) candidate, winning the Hlotse constituency. She defeated Lineo Molise, a sitting deputy minister. After the election, Mosothoane was made Minister for Education and Training in the coalition government formed by Prime Minister Tom Thabane of the All Basotho Convention (ABC). During her period as education minister, she introduced a new nationwide curriculum for primary schools, and also oversaw the localisation of secondary school examinations, which had previously been administered by Cambridge International Examinations (a British organisation).
762	In October 2014, Mosothoane was also appointed Minister for Communications, Science and Technology in an acting capacity, following the dismissal of Selibe Mochoboroane from the ministry. Mochoboroane claimed his removal was unlawful, and refused to vacate his office or give up his other ministerial resources. Mosothoane was replaced as acting minister by Joang Molapo in February 2015, at which point Mochoboroane was still disputing the legitimacy of his dismissal. Despite being a sitting minister, she was defeated in an LCD primary election prior to the 2015 general election, and consequently did not retain her seat in the National Assembly.
763	The community of Makholane includes the villages of Ha 'Mpeli, Ha Chopho, Ha Isaka, Ha Joase, Ha Joase (Khohloaneng), Ha Joase (Thabeng), Ha Khalala, Ha Khalienyane, Ha Khalienyane (Mokhoabong), Ha Khati, Ha Koili, Ha Koili (Santeng), Ha Koloboi (Mokhoabong), Ha Koranta, Ha Kotoane, Ha Lebeta, Ha Leemisa, Ha Lempetje (Aupolasi), Ha Lempetje (Ha Malimo), Ha Lesia, Ha Lesole (Mokhoabong), Ha Libete, Ha Likupa, Ha Lumisi, Ha Lumisi (Metheoaneng), Ha Mafeto, Ha Mahali, Ha Maholi, Ha Maholi (Mahlabatheng), Ha Mahosi, Ha Makhathe, Ha Makopela, Ha Malilimetsa, Ha Manehella, Ha Matlatsoaneng, Ha Matšaba, Ha Matsepe, Ha Matsie, Ha Mohapi, Ha Mohlomi, Ha Mokhasi (Mokhoabong), Ha Mokhuthu, Ha Motlohi, Ha Motlohi (Leralleng), Ha Mpata, Ha Nthinya, Ha Ntlhakeng, Ha Ntsiane, Ha Oni, Ha Pelesa, Ha Phokojoe, Ha Qobete, Ha Raborane, Ha Ralerata, Ha Raliemere, Ha Ramaleshoane, Ha Ramarothele, Ha Ramatheko, Ha Ramohapi, Ha Ramokoatsi, Ha Ramontsoe, Ha Ramporoane, Ha Rankapu, Ha Ranthokho, Ha Sebusi, Ha Seetsi, Ha Sekoati, Ha Sempe, Ha Sephula, Ha Setenane, Ha Setenane (Mahloleng), Ha Setenane (Moreneng), Ha Setenane (Motimposo), Ha Tauhali, Ha Teba, Khatleng, Likupa, Liphiring (Ha Ramohapi), Litsahaneng, Litšilong, Maieaneng, Makeneng, Mapolateng, Matlapaneng, Matsooeng, Matsoseng (Ha Lesole), Motse-Mocha, Noka-Ntšo, Qotata, Semakaleng, Thabaneng, Thabaneng (Borokhong), Thabaneng (Maikhokhong), Thabaneng (Sekantšing), Thelingoaneng (Ha Sempe), Thotaneng, Thoteng, Tieleng, Tsaeng and Tsekong.

765	Kabi was born in Khubetsoana in 1936, the eighth child of Eliza Phakisi and reverend Elijah Phakisi.  After attending the National University of Lesotho, she studied at Tennessee State University in the United States and St. Francis Xavier University in Canada. In 1958 she married Motete Kabi, with whom she had two daughters and two sons. Two years later she became a member of the Basutoland Congress Party (BCP). During the state of the emergency of the 1970s, Kabi was detained by police on fourteen occasions, and was tortured eleven times. She worked at the Institute of Extra Mural Studies at the National University of Lesotho and served as secretary general of the Women's League.
766	Khaketla was appointed as a senator by Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili in 2002 and served as Minister of Communications, Science and Technology from 2002 until 2004. At the 2007 election, she lost her seat but was elected to the National Assembly as one of the Lesotho Congress for Democracy members on a party list for proportional representation submitted by the National Independence Party. She served as Minister of Education and Training from 2007 until 2012. In 2011, Khaketla was one of seven women ministers in the Cabinet, alongside: Mannete Ramali, Maphoka Motoboli, Mathabiso Lepono, Mphu Keneileo Ramatlapeng, Mpeo Mahase-Moiloa and Pontso Suzan Matumelo Sekatle. On 30 March 2015 she was appointed Minister of Finance.
767	'Mantšebo's name at birth was Moipone Nkoebe. She was the daughter of Sempe Nkoebe, who was a chief in the Quthing region and a "ranking member of the royal dynasty". After completing her primary education, 'Mantšebo married Seeiso Griffith, the son of Griffith Lerotholi (who had succeeded his brother Letsie Lerotholi as paramount chief of Basutoland in 1913). She was her husband's first wife (or "senior wife"), and bore him a daughter, Ntšebo (who was ineligible to succeed to the throne). Seeiso married twice more, and had one son each by his second and third wives. His son by his second wife, Bereng (the future Moshoeshoe II), became his heir when he acceded to the throne in July 1939.
768	Seeiso died on 26 December 1940. He had been ill for some time, and during his illness authorised his chief counsellor, Gabasheane Masupha, to act as paramount chief while he was incapacitated. As Seeiso's heir, Bereng, was only two years old, Gabasheane initially continued as acting paramount chief after Seeiso's death. In January 1941, however, a council of the leading Basotho chiefs (collectively known as the "Sons of Moshoeshoe") was called to elect a permanent regent during Bereng's minority. 'Mantšebo was one of two candidates, along with Bereng Griffith (Seeiso's half-brother). The council voted 44–23 in her favour, and she had the support of all but one of the principal chiefs. She was subsequently recognised as regent by the British Resident Commissioner, Edmund Richards, and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Lord Moyne.
769	Despite the council's ruling, Bereng Griffith and his supporters refused to recognise 'Mantšebo as regent, and sued her in the High Court of Basutoland (which had only been established in 1938). Bereng put forward an argument that traditional law and custom prevented women from functioning as chiefs. He also contended that Seeiso and 'Mantšebo had married under the levirate custom, and therefore, as his brother's widow, he was obliged to marry her. However, the presiding judge rejected both of those arguments and upheld the decision of the council, allowing 'Mantšebo to continue as regent. Bereng continued to agitate for power until 1949, when he and the former regent Gabasheane were convicted of muti murder and hanged.
770	When 'Mantšebo was elected regent in 1940, she was also made the guardian of Seeiso's heir, her step-son Bereng. 'Mantšebo and Bereng's mother, 'Mabereng, were said to have "loathed each other thoroughly". 'Mabereng and her supporters contrived to keep him away from the direct control of the regent, as it was feared that 'Mantšebo (or one of her allies) might have him killed. At one point, rumours of an assassination attempt meant the boy was hidden in a cave for two days. As Bereng grew older, however, 'Mantšebo began to have more of a say in his affairs. She arranged to have him raised in her own Roman Catholic faith, and rejected a plan to have him taught at a non-denominational government school, despite the strong objections of his mother (a Protestant), the Legislative Council, and the Resident Commissioner. This conflict over schooling resulted in "a full-scale war between the royal widows", which only ended when Bereng left Lesotho to continue his education in England.
771	'Mantšebo has been described as a "shrewd and willing" leader who was skilled in dealing with the British administration, but yet unable to develop an "alternative national agenda". She employed various tactics to frustrate colonial officials, including feigning poor health and affecting frequent bouts of "tears and histrionics". Internally, 'Mantšebo laid the foundations for Lesotho's current constitutional monarchy. She agreed to consult the Basutoland National Council (the protectorate's legislative council) on certain matters, and supported the right to freedom of association, allowing political organisations to hold public meetings without interference. Basutoland's "first modern political parties" were formed in the 1950s, during her regency. However, 'Mantšebo herself was not politically neutral, and came to "informally support" the Basutoland National Party, which was led by Leabua Jonathan (a former advisor). By the late 1950s, she was facing increasing pressure to step aside and allow Bereng to assume the chiefship. Her intention was to remain regent until he had completed his university education and married. 'Mantšebo was eventually forced into "involuntary retirement" in March 1960.
772	She spent time as a practice teacher at Lovedale Missionary Institute, where among her pupils was Godfrey Kolisang. She next taught briefly at Thabana Morena Girls' School, before going on to Morija Training College in Morija. There she met Bennett Makalo Khaketla, who became her husband. Together they taught at Basutoland High School in Maseru, until he was dismissed for political activities, whereupon they went to Nigel in South Africa for work. In 1953 he returned to Lesotho to begin a political career, and she returned to Basutoland High School. 
773	Khaketla wrote 11 books, including poetry collections, in Sesotho. In 1979 she became the first Mosotho woman to be appointed an assessor on the High Court; she served on the council of the National University of Lesotho and on the government's National Planning Board. She was active on the Special Committee on the Status of Women on the Law Reform Commission. She was active in the Anglican Church and its Mothers' Union. In 1983 she was the first Mosotho to be awarded an honorary doctorate of literature by the National University. In 1997 she received the Gold Record of Achievement award from the American Biographical Institute.
774	Queen 'Masenate Mohato Seeiso was born Anna Karabo Motšoeneng in Mapoteng in the Berea District, the eldest daughter of the five children of Thekiso Motšoeneng and his wife 'Makarabo. She was christened Anna in the Roman Catholic Church. In 1990 Queen 'Masenate enrolled at the Machabeng International College in Maseru and studied there until 1996, completing an International General Certificate for Secondary Education and an International Baccalaureate Diploma. While attending college, she took party in community service with the Angela School for the Disabled and Centre for the Blind. In 1997 she attended the National University of Lesotho (NUL) and where she studied for a Bachelor of Science degree; her studies were interrupted by her relationship with King Letsie III of Lesotho.
775	In October 1999, two years into her studies at the National University of Lesotho, she became engaged to King Letsie III. They were married on February 18, 2000 in Maseru. He was the only unmarried King in Africa. The ceremony was conducted in the Setsoto Stadium by Archbishop Bernard Mohlalisi, with 40,000 people present including dignitaries such as Nelson Mandela, Festus Mogae, Bakili Muluzi and Prince Charles of the British Royal Family. This marked the first time in the history of modern Lesotho where a royal had married a commoner.
776	She credited the Royal Family for making her welcome, in particular the influence of Queen 'Mamohato, the Queen Mother. 'Masenate and 'Mamohato grew close and the Queen found it difficult when Mamohato died in 2003, but praised her husband for supporting her at the time. In an interview with the Lesotho Times in 2014, she said "I like the fact that he listens when I advise him on various issues that are personal. For instance, I want him to be well-dressed for various functions. And, as the woman of the house, I also recommend a lot of things, food, music, movies and more educative television channels for all of us. His Majesty is a very reserved, respectful, patient, wise and humble person and he is all that in a very sweet way. These are the qualities he has sustained over the years. They have drawn me much closer to him. I love him dearly every day."
777	Queen 'Masenate and King Letsie have three children; Princess Senate (b. 7 October 2001), Princess 'Maseeiso (b. 20 November 2004), and Prince Lerotholi (b. 18 April 2007). She later explained that she wished she had more children, saying "Maybe I should have had one early after Prince Lerotholi but now my biological clock is telling me the time is up. I have read a lot about reproductive health-related risks and some medical researchers, in their studies, don't recommend women to consider falling pregnant at my age. When your eggs are no longer that fresh to make a healthy baby, then it's better to be on the safe side."
778	She started her professional career as a civil servant. She attained a degree in accounting and went on to attend the National University of Lesotho, from which she graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce in 1981. From then on, she was employed in the office of the Prime Minister. At the same time, she attended management courses in the United Kingdom and Sweden. In 1991, she obtained a master's degree in Policy Analysis in the Netherlands. Around this time, she separated from her husband. Upon her return from the Netherlands, she was appointed to the Auditor General's office where she worked in the performance audit department. In 1999, she began working as a principal secretary in the newly established Ministry of Defence. She was the first woman to work in the department and was primarily responsible for the budget.
779	"'Maze" tends to sing Simon and Garfunkel songs when struck on the head. His best friend is Denton Fixx, a writer for BC Comics who looks like a beagle. Hunch is a millionaire, having won first place in a magazine subscription company's sweepstakes.  After winning the prize, he felt obligated to subscribe to all of the company's magazines.  As a result, he receives a staggering load of publications daily, including the pornographic magazines that he genuinely reads only for the articles.  He does not keep his wealth a secret per se; he simply does not mention it and does not live an opulent lifestyle. His friends are unaware of his financial success.
780	A back-up feature, "Zoot Sputnik", drawn by Fred Hembeck and (ostensibly) written by Denton Fixx, appeared for several issues; it was supposed to be the book Fixx wrote for BC Comics. "Zoot Sputnik" was a parody of the Golden Age narrative style where stories had no between-issue continuity — Zoot and his team were space adventurers in one issue and cowboys in the next. The team's dog received a shock of energy and gained the ability to remember their disparate adventures. This was Denton's attempt to introduce continuity to the book, but it was met with disapproval by his editor.
781	'Mazing Man is one of a handful of DC titles to publish an issue not featuring the Comics Code Authority stamp of approval while it was active. In the issue "Writer's Block", Denton is stuck for a story, and all his friends give their ideas. One of them dealt with an army of zombies. Although there was no gore or violence, any mention of the living dead, specifically the use of the word "zombie", was forbidden by the Comics Code. The issue was released without the seal, with no publicity, positive or negative.
782	'Merican is an EP by the American punk rock band the Descendents, released February 10, 2004. It was the band's first release for Fat Wreck Chords and served as a pre-release to their sixth studio album Cool to Be You, released the following month. The EP includes two songs from the album: "Nothing with You" and "'Merican", and three B-sides from the album's sessions: "Here with Me", "I Quit", and the hidden track "Alive". 'Merican marked the first release of new studio material from the Descendents since 1996's Everything Sucks and was their third release ever to chart, peaking at number 29 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers.
783	In 1987 Descendents singer Milo Aukerman had left the band to pursue a career in biochemistry. The remaining members—bassist Karl Alvarez, guitarist Stephen Egerton, and drummer Bill Stevenson—changed the band's name to All and released eight albums on Cruz Records and Interscope Records between 1988 and 1995 with singers Dave Smalley, Scott Reynolds, and Chad Price. Aukerman contributed occasional songwriting and backing vocals, and in 1995 decided to return to music. The members decided to operate as two bands, working with Aukerman as the Descendents and with Price as All. Both bands signed to Epitaph Records and the Descendents released Everything Sucks in 1996. Following the album's supporting tours Aukerman had returned to his science career, though he recorded backing vocals for All's 1998 album Mass Nerder. All also released Problematic in 2000 and Live Plus One in 2001, a double live album that included a Descendents disc recorded in 1996.
784	The recording sessions for the Descendents' sixth studio album Cool to Be You took place with Aukerman in February 2002 at The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado, with additional recording done in April at Planet of Sound in Wilmington, Delaware, and were produced by Stevenson. The band recorded the music for the songs live in the studio with minimal overdubbing, and Aukerman's vocals were recorded over the instrumental tracks. However, these recordings were not released for another two years. Stevenson explained that the gap of eight years between Descendents albums was due to the band members having children, and his father's death.
785	For the releases of 'Merican and Cool to Be You the Descendents signed to Fat Wreck Chords. Label head and musician Fat Mike was a longtime fan of the band, and his enthusiasm for working with them was a major factor in their decision to sign to the label. Stevenson commented that "If you've got the owner of the label saying he wants to put out a record by what is probably his favorite band of all time, that's rad. That's the best possible position for a band to be in." The 'Merican EP was released in February 2004, followed by the full-length album in March. Stevenson remarked that the EP served as a teaser for Cool to Be You: "It's funny because, from the old Descendents fan's point of view, it's kind of like 'What? Why did they put out this EP? It doesn't even have the best songs on it. I waited seven years for this?' But from the newer kids perspective, it's more like, hey let's try to introduce this new decade of kids to Descendents so it's at least on the tip of their tongue when the album comes out." 'Merican was released on both compact disc and extended play formats, each with a different cover, drawn by Jeff Hagedorn, depicting the band's Milo character dressed as Uncle Sam.
786	The songs on 'Merican address topics including love and relationships, sociopolitical commentary, and frustrations with life in a touring band. Aukerman remarked that "there's no part of the 'Merican EP that is a retread of anything we've done in the past. Some of the songs are major departures for us, like 'Here with Me,' and the hidden track 'Alive.' Even the title song is actually a stretch for us; if you look back on all the songs we have done, there are very few that have any 'political' content in them." "'Merican" addresses positive and negative aspects of American history, celebrating cultural figures such as Otis Redding, Duke Ellington, and Walt Whitman while condemning slavery, Joseph McCarthy, the Ku Klux Klan, and the Vietnam War.
787	I can't even count the number of times I've quit this band, dating back to 1982 and Milo Goes to College! Like most of my songs, "I Quit" is my attempt to capture those emotions that come and go, the transient ones. Those types of emotions, to me, make for the best songs because they tend to be extreme! So there is no "message" to the song, just me spewing about the negative aspects of band life. At the time I wrote the song, I really did want to quit. I don't really care how people take the song; as the line says, "I don't give a flying fuck what you think of me."
788	'Merican became the third Descendents release to chart (following Everything Sucks and Live Plus One), peaking at number 29 on Billboard's Top Independent Albums chart and at number 38 on Top Heatseekers. John Luerssen of Allmusic gave it three and a half stars out of five, remarking that "Nothing with You" "revisit[s] the timeless lovelorn attack of cherished songs from their past like 'Wendy,' 'Clean Sheets,' and 'Silly Girl'", while "'Merican" "harks back to vintage Bad Religion" and "I Quit" is "a nervous, edgy 'Catalina'-like throwback". He was less complimentary about the other two songs, calling "Here with Me" merely a "palatable midtempo number" and "Alive" "worth skipping, as it drags in a way that no Descendents number has a right to."
789	Gray was born in Pimlico, London, one of nine children of Edward Earl Gray, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Rebecca, née Daniels. Gray and his brother Danny were apprenticed to a juggling troupe when Gray was nine years old. His son, yet another Edward, was for many years the manager of the Coburg Hotel in Bayswater.As a juggler he toured Europe, the US, and Asia.  At first he performed as a straight, and highly skilled, juggler, but he gradually introduced into his act the deadpan humour for which he became known.
790	In November 1931 Gray appeared with Nervo and Knox and Naughton and Gold in a show called Crazy Week at the London Palladium.  The historian  David Goldie describes them as  giving "an impression of spontaneous mayhem throughout the theatre, with performances spilling into the auditorium and constant 'interruption gags' in which the performers would intrude into other acts on the bill." The show was a success, and further Crazy Weeks and Crazy Months followed. Flanagan and Allen joined the team in 1932, and the following year all seven members of the group appeared in the Royal Variety Performance in a bill that included Burns and Allen, Wilson, Keppel and Betty, Evelyn Laye and Billy Bennett.
791	In 1963 Gray played Senex in the first London production of Stephen Sondheim's A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum. Reviewing the show in The Observer, Bamber Gascoigne wrote that the piece had roles for five comics: Frankie Howerd, Kenneth Connor, Jon Pertwee, Robertson Hare and Gray. "All are good, but the highest laurels must go to Eddie Gray and Frankie Howerd for a wonderful quality of detachment. They both make a comic routine 10 times funnier by plodding through it as though it occupies only one-fifth of their attention."
792	The community of 'Moteng includes the villages of Bela-Bela, Boinyatso, Bokong (Khaphamali), Ha Hlakacha, Ha Khanye, Ha Lelala, Ha Lesiba, Ha Machefu, Ha Maieane, Ha Matela, Ha Moiloa, Ha Mokone, Ha Molapo, Ha Molumo, Ha Motapane, Ha Moteoli, Ha Mpotla, Ha Nkota, Ha Phakela, Ha Potomane, Ha Ramahotetsa, Ha Sekete (Paballong), Ha Taetsi, Ha Tlebere, Ha Tsolonyane, Khalikana, Khatleng, Khorong, Khubetsoana, Kolone, Lekhalong, Letsoana, Linotšing, Luma, Machubilane, Maholeng, Makareng, Makeneng, Marabeng, Marati, Maseru (Moteng), Mashapi, Masianokeng, Masoleng, Matebeleng, Mathebe, Mota Rifa, Motahane, Muela, Naleli, Nchekoane, Nyakoaneng, Ordendal, Palehong, Phahameng, Phahleng, Phatlalla, Phelandaba, Phohlane, Phomolong, Pote, Qobella, Sebataolong,Sentelina, Setlakalleng and Thabana-Tšooana.
793	The video directed by Chris Robinson presents comparison of different lifestyles while putting an accent on their similarities (like war is equal with street gang rivalries in the civil life). It is brought into effect with a comic-like city background with strong strokes that seems like a merge of a photo and a drawing. This "in-between" feeling is realized by masking the background with a non-lifelike orange pattern. Using Bluescreen technology to separate the actors/artists from the background the performers remain realistic and stand out from the whole picture. The casting includes Gabriel Casseus (from Lockdown) as the patron of a homeless and Faune A. Chambers (from White Chicks) as the mourning widow and the St. Lunatics as cameos.
794	'N Gatz We Truss is the second studio album by American rap group South Central Cartel. It was released on May 10, 1994 via South G.W.K. Records and Rush Associated Labels. Recording sessions took place at Kitchen Sync Studio in Hollywood, California with producers Prodeje and Havikk the Rhime Son, co-producers DJ Gripp, L.V. and DJ Kaos, and executive producer Cary "Havoc" Calvin. The album features guest performances by 2Pac, 3-2, Big Mike, Ice-T, MC Eiht and Spice 1, and also introduced a new member to the group, Patrick "Young Prodeje" Pitts.
795	In 1995, Chris Kirkpatrick met with Lou Pearlman to talk about forming a pop group. Pearlman said that he would finance the group if Kirkpatrick would find other young male singers to be with him in the band. This prompted Kirkpatrick to call Joey Fatone, a friend he had met while working at Universal Studios. Fatone and Kirkpatrick then approached Pearlman for more suggestions. Pearlman looked through some tapes they had, and one of Justin Timberlake from The Mickey Mouse Club caught their eye. Timberlake soon joined the group and recommended his friend Joshua "JC" Chasez, who also was a cast member.
796	Initially, Jason Galasso was chosen as the group's bass singer and fifth member. After several weeks of rehearsals, the group set up a showcase and began planning to officially sign with Pearlman's Trans Continental Label. However, at the last minute, Galasso dropped out as he was not fond of the group's musical direction, claiming that being a teen idol was never a goal of his. The group started to audition people to replace Galasso. Timberlake soon called his vocal coach, who suggested a 16-year-old from Mississippi named Lance Bass, who flew to Orlando to audition and was immediately accepted into the group.
797	The album's official lead single, "I Want You Back", was released in Germany on October 4, 1996, and reached the top 10 on November 18, 1996. The group's second single, "Tearin' Up My Heart", was released on February 10, 1997, also peaking within the top 10. The third single, "Here We Go", was released on May 5, 1997, just three weeks prior to the release of the album, to similar success. Their self-titled debut album was then released by BMG Ariola Munich on May 26, 1997, which peaked at number one on the second week of release in Germany. The group soon became an overnight success throughout much of Europe. The album also charted successfully in both Switzerland and Austria eventually selling 820,000 units in GSA (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) region and Eastern Europe. Two further singles, "For the Girl Who Has Everything" and "Together Again", were subsequently released on August 18 and November 3, 1997, respectively, achieving success in Germany and other European territories.
798	Following their success of their début album in several European territories, the band captured the attention of Vincent DeGiorgio, an A&R rep for RCA Records. After watching the group perform a rendition of their single "Together Again" in Budapest in November 1997, he offered them a record deal with RCA, which the group immediately agreed to. On January 20, 1998, their first German single, "I Want You Back", was released in both the United Kingdom and the United States, becoming their first single in both territories, achieving success on both the UK Singles Chart and the Billboard Hot 100. Around this time, RCA Records announced that they wished to release the group's debut album, which was previously only released in Germany, in both the U.K. and the U.S., however, wanted to make adjustments to suit both markets. This resulted in the tracks "Riddle", "Best of My Life", "More Than a Feeling", "Together Again" and "Forever Young" being cut altogether, and new mixes of "I Want You Back", "Tearin' Up My Heart" and "For the Girl Who Has Everything" being recorded. The new version of the album also included four new tracks: "I Just Wanna Be with You", "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You", "Everything I Own", "Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)". This version of the album was subsequently released in the United States on March 24, 1998.
799	On June 30, 1998, the group's second German single, "Tearin' Up My Heart", was released in both the U.K. and the U.S., once again achieving success on both charts. Further edits were made for the British version of the album, including remixes of "Thinking of You (I Drive Myself Crazy)", "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You" and "For the Girl Who Has Everything", plus an all-new track, "U Drive Me Crazy", written exclusively for the British market. This version of the album was released in the UK on July 5, 1998. At first, sales of the album were mediocre in both British and American territories, until the band's worldwide broadcast Disney Summer Concert in 1998. After the concert was aired, sales of the album began to skyrocket. It reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and shipped over 10 million copies in the United States alone, making it certified 10× Platinum and earning the group an RIAA diamond award. On February 9, 1999, a third single from the new version of the album, "(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You", was released exclusively in the United States, peaking at #8 on the Billboard Hot 100. They then went on to become the #3 top-selling boy-band group of all time.
800	The album debuted at number eighty two on the Billboard 200 the week of April 11, 1998, with sales of approximately 14,000 units. After six months, on October 10, 1998, the album reached and peaked at number 2 on the chart and remained on it for one hundred and nine weeks.It spent a total of thirty weeks inside the top 10. The album spent three weeks at number 2 from September 1998 to January 1999. It peaked behind three different number-one blockbuster albums: Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, Garth Brooks' Double Live and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it was the fifth best selling record of 1998 in the United States with 4,400,000 copies sold. The album was certified ten times platinum by the RIAA on January 5, 2000, denoting shipments of ten millions. The album has sold 9,854,000 copies in the US according to Nielsen Music (as of March, 2015) with an additional 1.50 million units at the BMG Music Club (as of early 2003). In the United Kingdom the album debuted and peaked at number 30 on July 11, 1999, and remained on the chart for only three weeks. Worldwide, the album has sold 15,540,000 copies.
801	The 'Ndrangheta was already known during the reign of the Bourbons of Naples. In the spring of 1792, there was the first official report in history on the 'Ndrangheta, and a mission as "Royal Visitor" was entrusted to Giuseppe Maria Galanti; these travelled far and wide throughout most of Calabria, often also making use of reports (answers written on the basis of a sort of questionnaire to fixed questions, prepared by himself) of local notables deemed reliable and trusted. This resulted in a bleak picture, as well as on the economic situation in the region, especially on that of public order. This work has been analyzed by various contemporary historians.Luca Addante writes in the introduction to the re-edition of Galanti's report ("Giornale di viaggio in Calabria", Rubbettino Editore, 2008): "the murders, thefts, the kidnappings were infinite; the ignorance of the clergy was scandalous; the village notables, obsessed with the idea of enriching themselves and then ennobling themselves, rapacious monopolizers of local administrations, who grew up in the shadow of a decadent nobility whose remains were being prepared." Galanti, in particular, reports in the Giornale the descriptions of disturbing crime phenomena, noting how the inefficient administration of justice, the corruption and the monopoly of the barons, was starting to produce cases, as in Maida, of "a small bunch of young, freeloaded young men who commit violence with the use of firearms. Justice is idle because without force and without a system. Malicious people become policemen (a sort of urban guard)." In the District of Gerace, "the raids of the criminals in the countryside are general. Almost all the militiamen are the most troublemakers in the province because the criminals and the debtors adopt this profession and are guaranteed by commanders in contempt of the laws. With this, the crimes, which grow every day".
802	In the folk culture surrounding 'Ndrangheta in Calabria, references to the Spanish Garduña often appear. Aside from these references, however, there is nothing to substantiate a link between the two organizations. The Calabrian word 'Ndrangheta derives from Greek ἀνδραγαθία andragathía for "heroism" and manly "virtue" or ἀνδράγαθος andrágathos, compound words of ἀνήρ, anḗr (gen. ἀνδρóς, andrós), i.e. man, and ἀγαθός, agathós, i.e. good, brave, meaning a courageous man. In many areas of Calabria the verb 'ndranghitiari, from the Greek verb andragathízesthai, means "to engage in a defiant and valiant attitude".
803	Until 1975, the 'Ndrangheta restricted their Italian operations to Calabria, mainly involved in extortion and blackmailing. Their involvement in cigarette contraband expanded their scope and contacts with the Sicilian Mafia and the Neapolitan Camorra. With the arrival of large public works in Calabria, skimming of public contracts became an important source of income. Disagreements over how to distribute the spoils led to the First 'Ndrangheta war killing 233 people. The prevailing factions began to kidnap rich people located in northern Italy for ransom. A high-profile case was the 1973 kidnapping of John Paul Getty III, who had his severed ear mailed to a newspaper in November, and later released in December following the negotiated payment of $2.2 million by Getty's grandfather, J. Paul Getty.
804	On 9 October 2012, following a months-long investigation by the central government, the City Council of Reggio Calabria headed by Mayor Demetrio Arena was dissolved for alleged ties to the group. Arena and all the 30 city councilors were sacked to prevent any "mafia contagion" in the local government.This was the first time a government of a capital of a provincial government was dismissed. Three central government-appointed administrators will govern the city for 18 months until new elections. The move came after unnamed councilors were suspected of having ties to the 'Ndrangheta under the 10-year centre-right rule of Mayor Giuseppe Scopelliti.
805	'Ndrangheta infiltration of political offices is not limited to Calabria. On 10 October 2012, the commissioner of Milan's regional government in charge of public housing, Domenico Zambetti of People of Freedom (PDL), was arrested on accusations he paid the 'Ndrangheta in exchange for an election victory and to extort favours and contracts from the housing official, including construction tenders for the World Expo 2015 in Milan. The probe of alleged vote-buying underscores the infiltration of the 'Ndrangheta in the political machine of Italy's affluent northern Lombardy region. Zambetti's arrest marked the biggest case of 'Ndrangheta infiltration so far uncovered in northern Italy and prompted calls for Lombardy governor Roberto Formigoni to resign.
806	In 2014, in the FBI and Italian police joint operation New Bridge, members of both the Gambino and Bonanno families were arrested, as well as ten members of the Ursino clan. Raffaele Valente was among the arrested. In Italian wiretaps, he revealed that he had set up a faction of the Ursino 'Ndrangheta in New York City. Valente was convicted for attempting to sell a sawn-off shotgun and a silencer to an undercover FBI agent for $5000 at a bakery in Brooklyn. He was sentenced to 3 years and one month in prison. Gambino associate Franco Lupoi and his father-in-law, Nicola Antonio Simonetta, were described as the linchpins of the operation. In June 2014, Pope Francis denounced the 'Ndrangheta for their "adoration of evil and contempt of the common good" and vowed that the Church would help tackle organized crime, saying that Mafiosi were excommunicated. A spokesperson for the Vatican clarified that the pope's words did not constitute a formal excommunication under canon law, as a period of legal process is required beforehand.
807	On 9 January 2018, law enforcement in Italy and Germany arrested 169 people in connection with the 'Ndrangheta mafia, specifically the Farao and Marincola clans based in Calabria. Assets worth €50 million (£44/$59m) were seized. The indictment mentions that owners of German restaurants, ice cream parlours, hotels and pizzerias were forced to buy wine, pizza dough, pastries and other products made in southern Italy. The Farao clan was being led by life-imprisoned Giuseppe Farao, before the arrests, and was passing orders onto his sons. They controlled bakeries, vineyards, olive groves, funeral homes, launderettes, plastic recycling plants and shipyards. The waste disposal of the Ilva steel company based in Taranto was also infiltrated. Some of the charges were mafia association, attempted murder, money laundering, extortion and illegal weapons possession and trafficking. Italian prosecutor, Nicola Gratteri, said that the arrests were the most important step taken against the 'Ndrangehta within the past 20 years. Eleven suspects were detained and accused of blackmailing and money laundering. They were deported back to Italy. Alessandro Figliomeni, former Mayor of Siderno, Calabria, was sentenced to 12 years in prison on 7 May 2018. He is alleged to be a member of the Commisso 'ndrina clan and served in the top hierarchy.
808	In December 2019, more than 300 people were arrested in Calabria on suspicion of belonging to the 'Ndrangheta in an operation involving 2,500 police. Among those arrested was Giancarlo Pittelli, a prominent lawyer and former member of Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party. The arrests were said by Nicola Gratteri, the chief prosecutor in Catanzaro, to be the second largest in number in the history of Italian organised crime, after those that led to the so-called "Maxi Trial" of Sicilian Mafia bosses in Palermo between 1986 and 1992. The trial against the more than 300 'Ndrangheta members began on 13 January 2021.
809	Italian anti-organized crime agencies estimated in 2007 that the 'Ndrangheta has an annual revenue of about € 35–40 billion (US$50–60 billion), which amounts to approximately 3.5% of the GDP of Italy. This comes mostly from illegal drug trafficking, but also from ostensibly legal businesses such as construction, restaurants and supermarkets. The 'Ndrangheta has a strong grip on the economy and governance in Calabria. According to a US Embassy cable leaked by WikiLeaks, the 'Ndrangheta controls huge segments of its territory and economy, and accounts for at least three percent of Italy's GDP through drug trafficking, extortion, skimming of public contracts, and usury.
810	The principal difference with the Mafia is in recruitment methods. The 'Ndrangheta recruits members on the criterion of blood relationships resulting in an extraordinary cohesion within the family clan that presents a major obstacle to investigation. Sons of 'ndranghetisti are expected to follow in their fathers' footsteps, and go through a grooming process in their youth to become giovani d'onore (boys of honour) before they eventually enter the ranks as uomini d'onore (men of honour). There are relatively few Calabrian mafiosi who have opted out to become a pentito; at the end of 2002, there were 157 Calabrian witnesses in the state witness protection program. Unlike the Sicilian Mafia in the early 1990s, they have meticulously avoided a head-on confrontation with the Italian state.
811	Most of the groups (86) operate in the Province of Reggio Calabria, although a portion of the recorded 70 criminal groups based in the Calabrian provinces Catanzaro and Cosenza also appears to be formally affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta. The families are concentrated in poor villages in Calabria such as Platì, Locri, San Luca, Africo and Altomonte as well as the main city and provincial capital Reggio Calabria. San Luca is considered to be the stronghold of the 'Ndrangheta. According to a former 'ndranghetista, "almost all the male inhabitants belong to the 'Ndrangheta, and the Sanctuary of Polsi has long been the meeting place of the affiliates." Bosses from outside Calabria, from as far as Canada and Australia, regularly attend the meetings at the Sanctuary of Polsi.
812	The basic local organizational unit of the 'Ndrangheta is called a locale (local or place) with jurisdiction over an entire town or an area in a large urban center. A locale may have branches, called  'ndrina (plural:  'ndrine), in the districts of the same city, in neighbouring towns and villages, or even outside Calabria, in cities and towns in the industrial North of Italy in and around Turin and Milan: for example, Bardonecchia, an alpine town in the province of Turin in Piedmont, has been, the first municipality in northern Italy dissolved for alleged mafia infiltration, with the arrest of the historical 'Ndrangheta boss of the city, Rocco Lo Presti. The small towns of Corsico and Buccinasco in Lombardy are considered to be strongholds of the 'Ndrangheta. Sometimes sotto 'ndrine are established. These subunits enjoy a high degree of autonomy – they have a leader and independent staff. In some contexts the  'ndrine have become more powerful than the locale on which they formally depend. Other observers maintain that the  'ndrina is the basic organizational unit. Each  'ndrina is "autonomous on its territory and no formal authority stands above the " 'ndrina boss", according to the Antimafia Commission. The  'ndrina is usually in control of a small town or a neighborhood. If more than one  'ndrina operates in the same town, they form a locale.
813	Blood family and membership of the crime family overlap to a great extent within the 'Ndrangheta. By and large, the  'ndrine consist of men belonging to the same family lineage. Salvatore Boemi, anti-mafia prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, told the Italian Antimafia Commission that "one becomes a member for the simple fact of being born in a mafia family," although other reasons might attract a young man to seek membership, and non-kin have also been admitted. Marriages help cement relations within each  'ndrina and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence "a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given  'ndrina." Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.
814	At the bottom of the chain of command are the picciotti d'onore or soldiers, who are expected to perform tasks with blind obedience until they are promoted to the next level of cammorista, where they will be granted command over their own group of soldiers. The next level, separated by the  'ndrina but part of 'Ndrangheta, is known as santista and higher still is the vangelista, upon which the up-and-coming gangster has to swear their dedication to a life of crime on the Bible. The Quintino, also called Padrino, is the second-highest level of command in a 'Ndrangheta clan (name Ndrina), being made up of five privileged members of the crime family who report directly to the boss, the capobastone (head of command).
815	At least since the 1950s, the chiefs of the 'Ndrangheta locali have met regularly near the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Polsi in the municipality of San Luca during the September Feast. These annual meetings, known as the crimine, have traditionally served as a forum to discuss future strategies and settle disputes among the locali. The assembly exercises weak supervisory powers over the activities of all 'Ndrangheta groups. Strong emphasis was placed on the temporary character of the position of the crimine boss. A new representative was elected at each meeting. Far from being the "boss of bosses," the capo crimine actually has comparatively little authority to interfere in family feuds or to control the level of interfamily violence.
816	Since the end of the Second 'Ndrangheta war in 1991, the 'Ndrangheta is ruled by a collegial body or Commission, known as La Provincia. Its primary function is the settlement of inter-family disputes. The body, also referred to as the Commission in reference to its Sicilian counterpart, is composed of three lower bodies, known as mandamenti. One for the clans on the Ionic side (the Aspromonte mountains and Locride) of Calabria, a second for the Tyrrhenian side (the plains of Gioia Tauro) and one central mandamento for the city of Reggio Calabria.
817	According to Italian DIA (Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, Department of the Police of Italy against organized crime) and Guardia di Finanza (Italian Financial Police and Customs Police) the "'Ndrangheta is now one of the most powerful criminal organizations in the world." Economic activities of 'Ndrangheta include international cocaine and weapons smuggling, with Italian investigators estimating that 80% of Europe's cocaine passes through the Calabrian port of Gioia Tauro and is controlled by the 'Ndrangheta. However, according to a report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) and Europol, the Iberian Peninsula is considered the main entry point for cocaine into Europe and a gateway to the European market. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimated that in 2007 nearly ten times as much cocaine was intercepted in Spain (almost 38 MT) in comparison with Italy (almost 4 MT).
818	The 'Ndrangheta has had a remarkable ability to establish branches abroad, mainly through migration. The overlap of blood and mafia family seems to have helped the 'Ndrangheta expand beyond its traditional territory: "The familial bond has not only worked as a shield to protect secrets and enhance security, but also helped to maintain identity in the territory of origin and reproduce it in territories where the family has migrated."  'Ndrine are reported to be operating in northern Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, the rest of Europe, the United States, Canada, and Australia. One group of 'ndranghetistas discovered outside Italy was in Ontario, Canada, several decades ago. They were dubbed the Siderno Group by Canadian judges as most of its members hailed from and around Siderno.
819	Known by the name "The Honoured Society," the 'Ndrangheta controlled Italian-Australian organized crime all along the East Coast of Australia since the early 20th century. 'Ndrangheta operating in Australia include the Sergi, Barbaro and Papalia clans. Similarly in Victoria the major families are named as Italiano, Arena, Muratore, Benvenuto, and Condello. In the 1960s warfare among 'Ndrangheta clans broke out over the control of the Victoria Market in Melbourne, where an estimated $45 million worth of fruits and vegetables passed through each year. After the death of Domenico Italiano, known as Il Papa, different clans tried to gain control over the produce market. At the time it was unclear that most involved were affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta.
820	The 'Ndrangheta began in Australia in Queensland, where they continued their form of rural organized crime, especially in the fruit and vegetable industry. After the 1998–2006 Melbourne gangland killings which included the murder of 'Ndrangheta Godfather Frank Benvenuto. In 2008, the 'Ndrangheta were tied to the importation of 15 million ecstasy pills to Melbourne, at the time the world's largest ecstasy haul. The pills were hidden in a container-load of tomato cans from Calabria. Australian 'Ndrangheta boss Pasquale Barbaro was arrested. Pasquale Barbaro's father Francesco Barbaro was a boss throughout the 1970s and early 1980s until his retirement. Several of the Barbaro clan, including among others, Francesco, were suspected in orchestrating the murder of Australian businessman Donald Mackay in July 1977 for his anti-drugs campaign.
821	The 'Ndrangheta are also tied to large cocaine imports. Up to 500 kilograms of cocaine was documented relating to the mafia and Australian associates smuggled in slabs of marble, plastic tubes and canned tuna, coming from South America to Melbourne via Italy between 2002 and 2004. A report in 2016 by Vice Media indicated that the activities continued to be profitable: "Between 2004 and 2014, the gang's members amassed more than $10 million [$7.6 million USD] in real estate and race horses in Victoria alone pouring money into wholesalers, cafes, and restaurants".
822	According to a May 2018 news report, "Siderno's Old World 'Ndrangheta boss sent acolytes to populate the New World" including Michele (Mike) Racco who settled in Toronto in 1952, followed by other mob families. By 2010, investigators in Italy said that Toronto's 'Ndrangheta had climbed "to the top of the criminal world" with "an unbreakable umbilical cord" to Calabria. In the 2018 book, The Good Mothers: The True Story of the Women Who Took on the World's Most Powerful Mafia, Alex Perry reports that the Calabrian 'Ndrangheta has, for the past decade, been replacing the Sicilian Cosa Nostra as the primary drug traffickers in North America.
823	The Canadian 'Ndrangheta is believed to be involved in various activities including the smuggling of unlicensed tobacco products through ties with criminal elements in cross-border Native American tribes. According to Alberto Cisterna of the Italian National Anti-Mafia Directorate, the 'Ndrangheta has a heavy presence in Canada. "There is a massive number of their people in North America, especially in Toronto. And for two reasons. The first is linked to the banking system. Canada's banking system is very secretive; it does not allow investigation. So Canada is the ideal place to launder money. The second reason is to smuggle drugs." The 'Ndrangheta have found Canada a useful North American entry point. The organization used extortion, loan sharking, theft, electoral crimes, mortgage and bank fraud, crimes of violence and cocaine trafficking.
824	A Canadian branch labelled the Siderno Group – because its members primarily came from the Ionian coastal town of Siderno in Calabria – is the one discussed earlier. It has been active in Canada since the 1950s, originally formed by Michele (Mike) Racco who was the head of the Group until his death in 1980. Siderno is also home to one of the 'Ndrangheta's biggest and most important clans, heavily involved in the global cocaine business and money laundering. Antonio Commisso, the alleged leader of the Siderno group, is reported to lead efforts to import "... illicit arms, explosives and drugs ..." Elements of 'Ndrangheta have been reported to have been present in Hamilton, Ontario as early as 1911. Historical crime families in the Hamilton area include the Musitanos, Luppinos and Papalias.
825	According to an agreed Statement of Fact filed with the court, "the Locali [local cells] outside of Calabria replicate the structure from Calabria, and are connected to their mother-Locali in Calabria. The authority to start Locali outside Calabria comes from the governing bodies of the organization in Calabria. The Locali outside of Calabria are part of the same 'Ndrangheta organization as in Calabria, and maintain close relationships with the Locali where its members come from." The group's activities in the Greater Toronto Area were controlled by a group known as the 'Camera di Controllo' which "makes all of the final decisions", according to the witness' testimony. It consists of six or seven Toronto-area men, who co-ordinate activities and resolves disputes among Calabrian gangsters in Southern Ontario. In 1962, Racco established a crimini or Camera di Controllo in Canada with the help of Giacomo Luppino and Rocco Zito. One of the members was Giuseppe Coluccio, before he was arrested and extradited to Italy. Other members are Vincenzo DeMaria, Carmine Verduci before his death, and Cosimo Stalteri before his death. In August 2015, the IRB issued a deportation order for Carmelo Bruzzese. Bruzzese appealed the decision to Canada's Federal Court, but it was rejected, and on 2 October 2015, Bruzzese was escorted onto a plane in Toronto, landing in Rome, where he was arrested by Italian police. Major Giuseppe De Felice, a commander with the Carabinieri, told the IRB that Bruzzese "assumed the most important roles and decisions. He gave the orders."
826	In June 2018, Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, of Woodbridge, Ontario and an unrelated woman were shot and killed. According to sources contacted by the Toronto Star, "Commisso was related to Cosimo "The Quail" Commisso of Siderno, Italy, who has had relations in Ontario, is considered by police to be a "'Ndrangheta organized crime boss". The National Post reported that Cosimo Ernesto Commisso, while not a known criminal, "shares a name and family ties with a man who has for decades been reputed to be a Mafia leader in the Toronto area". The cousin of "The Quail", Antonio Commisso, was on the list of most wanted fugitives in Italy until his capture on 28 June 2005, in Woodbridge.
827	In June 2015, RCMP led police raids across the Greater Toronto Area, named Project OPhoenix, which resulted in the arrest of 19 men, allegedly affiliated with the 'Ndrangheta. In March 2018, during the resultant criminal trial north of Toronto, the court heard from a Carabinieri lieutenant-colonel that 'Ndrangheta is active in Germany, Australia and the Greater Toronto Area. "People in Italy have to be responsible for their representatives here but the final word comes from Italy". A member of the Greater Toronto Area's 'Ndrangheta cell, Carmine Guido, who had been a police informant, testified at length in 2018 about the structure and activities of the organization which had been under the control of Italian-born Bradford, Ontario resident, Giuseppe (Pino) Ursino and Romanian-born Cosmin (Chris) Dracea of Toronto. The latter two faced two counts of cocaine trafficking for the benefit of a criminal organization and one charge of conspiracy to commit an indictable offence. Guido was paid $2.4 million by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police between 2013 and 2015 to secretly tape dozens of conversations with suspected 'Ndrangheta members. In February 2019, Ursino was sentenced to 11 and a half years in prison on drug trafficking charges, with Dracea sentenced to nine years in prison on cocaine trafficking conspiracy. Neither had a previous criminal record. At the sentencing, the presiding judge made this comment: "Based on the evidence at trial, Giuseppe Ursino is a high-ranking member of the 'Ndrangheta who orchestrated criminal conduct and then stepped back to lessen his potential implication" ... Cosmin Dracea knew he was dealing with members of a criminal organization when he conspired to import cocaine".
828	During the Ursino/Dracea trial, an Italian police expert testified that the 'Ndrangheta operated in the Greater Toronto Area and in Thunder Bay particularly in drug trafficking, extortion, loan sharking, theft of public funds, robbery, fraud, electoral crimes and crimes of violence. After the trial, Tom Andreopoulos, deputy chief federal prosecutor, said that this was the first time in Canada that the 'Ndrangheta was targeted as an organized crime group since 1997, when the Criminal Code was amended to include the offence of criminal organization. He offered this comment about the organization:
829	On 18 July 2019, the York Regional Police announced the largest organized crime bust in Ontario, part of an 18-month long operation called Project Sindicato that was also coordinated with the Italian State Police. York Regional Police had arrested 15 people in Canada, 12 people in Calabria, and seized $35 million worth of homes, sports cars and cash in a major trans-Atlantic probe targeting the most prominent wing of the 'Ndrangheta in Canada headed by Angelo Figliomeni. On 14 and 15 July, approximately 500 officers raided 48 homes and businesses across the GTA, seizing 27 homes worth $24 million, 23 cars, including five Ferraris, and $2 million in cash and jewelry. Nine of the 15 arrests in Canada included major crime figures: Angelo Figliomeni, Vito Sili, Nick Martino, Emilio Zannuti, Erica Quintal, Salvatore Oliveti, Giuseppe Ciurleo, Rafael Lepore and Francesco Vitucci. The charges laid included tax evasion, money laundering, defrauding the government and participating in a criminal organization.
830	In 2020, the charges laid against three individuals as a result of Project Sindicato were "stayed" (the prosecution discontinued), unless the prosecutors could find new evidence and proceeded with the charges again within one year. In January 2021, the charges against the remaining six were also stayed, including that of Angelo Figliomeni, "the head of the 'Ndrangheta in Toronto" according to York Regional Police. The charges were stayed after an investigation "into the use of the privileged conversations" that found "improper use of wiretapping" and "significant breaches of solicitor-client privilege". All property seized by police must now be returned — with the exception of illegal possessions.
831	According to a study by the German foreign intelligence service, the Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND), 'Ndrangheta groups are using Germany to invest cash from drugs and weapons smuggling. Profits are invested in hotels, restaurants and houses, especially along the Baltic coast and in the eastern German states of Thuringia and Saxony. Investigators believe that the mafia's bases in Germany are used primarily for clandestine financial transactions. In 1999, the state Office of Criminal Investigation in Stuttgart investigated an Italian from San Luca who had allegedly laundered millions through a local bank, the Sparkasse Ulm. The man claimed that he managed a profitable car dealership, and authorities were unable to prove that the business was not the source of his money. The Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) concluded in 2000 that "the activities of this 'Ndrangheta clan represent a multi-regional criminal phenomenon." In 2009, a confidential report by the BKA said some 229 'Ndrangheta families were living in Germany, and were involved in gun-running, money laundering, drug-dealing, and racketeering, as well as legal businesses. Some 900 people were involved in criminal activity, and were also legal owners of hundreds of restaurants, as well as being major players in the property market in the former East. The most represented 'Ndrangheta family originated from the city of San Luca (Italy), with some 200 members in Germany. A war between the two 'Ndrangheta clans Pelle-Romeo (Pelle-Vottari) and Strangio-Nirta from San Luca that had started in 1991 and resulted in several deaths spilled into Germany in 2007; six men were shot to death in front of an Italian restaurant in Duisburg on 15 August 2007. (See San Luca feud.) According to the head of the German federal police service, Joerg Ziercke, "Half of the criminal groups identified in Germany belong to the 'Ndrangheta. It has been the biggest criminal group since the 1980s. Compared to other groups operating in Germany, the Italians have the strongest organization."
832	Sebastiano Strangio allegedly lived for 10 years in the Netherlands, where he managed his contacts with Colombian cocaine cartels. He was arrested in Amsterdam on 27 October 2005. The seaports of Rotterdam and Amsterdam are used to import cocaine. The Giorgi, Nirta and Strangio clans from San Luca have a base in the Netherlands and Brussels (Belgium). In March 2012, the head of the Dutch National Crime Squad (Dienst Nationale Recherche, DNR) stated that the DNR will team up with the Tax and Customs Administration and the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service to combat the 'Ndrangheta.
833	David Gonzi, a son of former Prime Minister of Malta Lawrence Gonzi, was accused of illegal activities by acting as a trustee shareholder in a gaming company. The company in question was operated by a Calabrian associate of the 'Ndrangheta in Malta. His name appeared several times on an investigation document of over 750 pages that was commissioned by the tribunal of the Reggio Calabria. Gonzi called the document unprofessional. A European arrest warrant was published for Gonzi to appear at the tribunal but this never materialised. Gonzi, however, was completely exonerated from the list of potential suspects in the 'Ndrangheta gaming bust.
834	In February 2018, Slovak investigative journalist Ján Kuciak was shot dead at his home together with his fiancée. At the time of his murder, Kuciak was working on a report about Slovak connections with the 'Ndrangheta. He had previously reported on organized tax fraud involving businesspeople close to the ruling Smer-SD party. On 28 February, Aktuality.sk published Kuciak's last, unfinished story. The article details the activities of Italian businessmen with ties to organised crime who have settled in eastern Slovakia, and have spent years embezzling European Union funds intended for the development of this relatively poor region, as well as their connections to high-ranking state officials, such as Viliam Jasaň, a deputy and the Secretary of the State Security Council of Slovakia, or Mária Trošková, a former nude model who became Chief Adviser of Prime Minister Robert Fico. Both Jasaň and Trošková took leave of absence on the same day, stating that they would return to their positions once the investigations were concluded.
835	The crime syndicate has a significant presence in Switzerland since the early 1970s but has operated there with little scrutiny due to the inconspicuous life styles of their members, the Swiss legal landscape, and solid foundations in local businesses. In the aftermath of the San Luca feud in 2007 and subsequent arrests in Italy (Operation "Crimine"), it became clear that the group had also infiltrated the economically proliferous regions of Switzerland and Southern Germany. In March 2016, Swiss law enforcement in cooperation with Italian state prosecutors arrested a total of 15 individuals, 13 in the city of Frauenfeld, 2 in the canton of Valais, accusing them of active membership to an organized crime syndicate also known as "Operazione Helvetica". Since 2015, the Swiss federal police has conducted undercover surveillance and recorded the group's meetings in a restaurant establishment in a small village just outside of Frauenfeld. The meetings were taking place in a relatively remote location using the now defunct entity the "Wängi Boccia Club" as its cover. According to the Italian prosecutor Antonio De Bernardo, there are several cells operating within the jurisdiction of the Swiss Federation, estimating the number of operatives per cell to about 40, and a couple of 100 in total. All of the arrested persons are Italian citizens, the two men arrested in the Valais have already been extradited to Italy, and as of August 2016, one individual arrested in Frauenfeld has been approved for extradition to Italy.
836	The earliest evidence of 'Ndrangheta activity in the U.S. points to an intimidation scheme run by the syndicate in Pennsylvania mining towns; this scheme was unearthed in 1906. Current 'Ndrangheta activities in America mainly involve drug trafficking, arms smuggling, and money laundering. It is known that the 'Ndrangheta branches in North America have been associating with Italian-American organized crime. The Suraci family from Reggio Calabria has moved some of its operations to the U.S. The family was founded by Giuseppe Suraci who has been in the United States since 1962. His younger cousin, Antonio Roglianoruns the family in Calabria. On Tuesday, 11 February 2014, both F.B.I. and Italian Police intercepted the transatlantic network of U.S. and Italian crime families. The raid targeted the Gambino and Bonanno families in the U.S. while in Italy, it targeted the Ursino  'ndrina from Gioiosa Jonica. The defendants were charged with drug trafficking, money laundering and firearms offenses, based, in part, on their participation in a transnational heroin and cocaine trafficking conspiracy involving the 'Ndrangheta. The operation began in 2012 when investigators detected a plan by members of the Ursino clan of the 'Ndrangheta to smuggle large amounts of drugs. An undercover agent was dispatched to Italy and was successful in infiltrating the clan. An undercover agent was also involved in the handover of 1.3 kg of heroin in New York as part of the infiltration operation.
837	Beginning in 2000, music producer Francesco Sbano released three CD compilations of Italian mafia folk songs over a five-year period. Collectively known as La musica della mafia, these compilations consist mainly of songs written by 'Ndrangheta musicians, often sung in Calabrian and dealing with themes such as vengeance (Sangu chiama sangu), betrayal (I cunfirenti), justice within the 'Ndrangheta (Nun c'è pirdunu), and the ordeal of prison life (Canto di carcerato). The 2013 book ZeroZeroZero by Roberto Saviano investigates the activities of the 'Ndrangheta in Italy. Stefano Sollima adapted the book into a 2020 TV series of the same name.
838	The  'ndrina (Italian: [nˈdriːna], plural: 'ndrine; Calabrian: [ɳˈɖɽiːna],  plural: 'ndrini) is the basic unit of the 'Ndrangheta of Calabria, made up of blood relatives, and is the equivalent of the Sicilian Mafia’s "family" or cosca. The word derives from the Greek, meaning "a man who does not bend". Each  'ndrina is "autonomous on its territory and no formal authority stands above the  'ndrina boss." The  'ndrina is usually in control of a small town or a neighbourhood in larger cities, even outside Calabria, in cities and towns in the industrial North of Italy in and around Turin and Milan.
839	Blood family and membership of the crime family overlap to a great extent within the 'Ndrangheta. By and large, the  'ndrine consist of men belonging to the same family lineage under the command of the capobastone. Salvatore Boemi, Anti-mafia prosecutor in Reggio Calabria, told the Italian Antimafia Commission that "one becomes a member for the simple fact of being born in a mafia family," although other reasons might attract a young man to seek membership, and non-kin have also been admitted. Marriages help cement relations within each  'ndrina and to expand membership. As a result, a few blood families constitute each group, hence "a high number of people with the same last name often end up being prosecuted for membership of a given  'ndrina." Indeed, since there is no limit to the membership of a single unit, bosses try to maximize descendants.
840	 'Nduja is made using meat from the head (minus the jowls, which are used for guanciale), trimmings from various meat cuts, some clean skin, fatback, and roasted Calabrian chilli peppers, which give  'nduja its characteristic fiery taste. It is all minced together, then stuffed in large sausage casings and smoked, creating a soft large sausage, from where the spicy mixture later is scooped out as needed. 'Nduja is mainly served with slices of bread or with ripe cheese. Its unique taste makes it suitable for a variety of dishes. For example, it can be added to pasta sauces. It is sold in jars or as thick slices from the soft 'Nduja sausage.
841	Captain Frank Hollis (Martyn Keith) is engaged to Eileen Delmont (Lottie Lyell). When her brother Eric commits a theft, Frank accepts the blame in order to protect her family's name. He leaves for Australia and joins the New South Wales mounted police. Eric confesses and Eileen and her father go to Australia to track down Frank. They buy a property, some of their cattle is stolen and request a trooper come to their aid – it is Frank. On the way out to see them, Frank is captured by the thieves and is thrown in the river, but Eileen comes to his aid and the lovers are reunited.
842	'Neile Alina 'Mantoa Fanana was born in 1945. Fanana was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree in Law by the National University of Lesotho in 1980. She subsequently attended the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom where she was awarded Bachelor of Laws and Master of Philosophy degrees. Fanana went on to lecture at the National University and received further training  human rights law, international humanitarian law and the resolution of conflicts. In 1989 she presented a paper on the treatment of women under Lesotho's inheritance law to a regional legal seminar.
843	Upon the restoration of democracy to Lesotho in 1993 Fanana worked with the Ministry of Justice, Human Rights and Correctional Services to improve administration and reduce corruption.  She also helped to bring new legislation forward to improve the rights of women and children and to restrict money laundering and corruption.  Fanana was appointed King's Counsel, a status conferred on senior barristers, in 2009.  By 2010 Fanana had become dean and pro-vice chancellor of the National University.  She has written for the Lesotho Law Journal on the rights of citizens under the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, women's rights, and legal dualism.
844	The extended play was first announced on July 24, 2008 at Sakanaction's official website. At the band's official MySpace page, footage of "Mikazuki Sunset" from the concert was uploaded. After its release on August 6, the extended play managed to top iTunes Japan's rock chart, surpassing Coldplay's Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends. In December, Sakanaction released their first physical single release, "Sen to Rei". On the limited edition version of the release, a recording of "Yoru no Higashigawa" from the same concert was added as a bonus track.
845	Each article is about 200 words long, detailing the location of the shooting and the number of victims but otherwise remaining essentially the same. A fictitious resident of a state in which the shooting did not take place is quoted as saying that the shooting was "a terrible tragedy", but "there's nothing anyone can do to stop them". The article ends by pointing out that the United States is the "only economically advanced nation in the world where roughly two mass shootings have occurred every month for the past eight years" and that Americans view themselves and the situation as "helpless".
846	The article was first published on May 27, 2014, following the Isla Vista shooting. Since then, The Onion has republished the same article 18 times to date, nearly verbatim, with only minor changes to reflect the specifics of each shooting. In 2017, managing editor for The Onion Marnie Shure stated: "By re-running the same commentary it strengthens the original commentary tenfold each time. ... In the wake of these really terrible things, we have this comment that really holds up." After The Onion republished the article on February 14, 2018, following the Parkland shooting, Jason Roeder, the writer of the original 2014 article, tweeted that he "had no idea it would be applied to the high school a mile from [his] house".
847	The New York Times wrote that "each time The Onion publishes this particular headline, it seems to rocket around the internet with more force" and that the headline "with each use, seemed to turn from cheeky political commentary on gun control into a reverberation of despair." Mashable wrote that "[n]othing captures that feeling of frustration and powerlessness" following major mass shootings as well as these Onion articles, adding that "[t]here's no shortage of brilliant Onion pieces, but none have resonated—or been as tragically prescient—like the 'No Way' post." The Washington Post wrote that, with these articles, The Onion "appears to capture the frustration and futility felt by so many people" following mass shootings, noting the increased Internet traffic the articles draw and how popular they are on social media. The Huffington Post cites these articles as "some of the most resonant commentary on the nation's total lack of action on gun violence". It goes on to say that they have become "a staple of the social media response to mass shootings", citing how widely-shared they are on Facebook and Twitter. The Daily Beast mentioned the articles in a piece titled "How 'The Onion' Became One of the Strongest Voices for Gun Control". Similarly, Wired mentioned it in an article discussing the power of The Onion's satire in the face of gun violence, titled "Only The Onion Can Save Us Now".
848	'Nuff Said was the third album released by Ike & Tina Turner in 1971; commercially their most successful year. The release of Workin' Together in December 1970 produced their hit single "Proud Mary" which helped propel the album to No. 3 on the Billboard Soul LP chart. In February 1971, Capitol Records reissued their album Get It – Get It and re-titled it Her Man. . . His Woman. Their live album What You Hear Is What You Get was released in July and peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Soul LP chart. They were also included on the soundtrack Soul To Soul which was released in September and peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Soul LPs chart.

850	In 1862, Francis II of Bourbon, the last king of the Two Sicilies, lives in exile in Rome (capital city of the Papal States) with his wife Maria Sophie and the butler Rafele. The king has lost his throne after the conquest of his kingdom by the forces of Giuseppe Garibaldi and the Piedmontese Army. Maria Sophie tries to recover the Kingdom of Naples, supporting the uprising of patriots, rebels and outlaws (named "briganti" by the Piedmontese Government), but Francesco is demoralized and has no intention of fighting. The king in fact closes in himself, expressing interest in religion and the supernatural...
851	In November 1972, shortly after her father's death, Mazzucchi's daughter lodged a declaration with Italy’s Office of Literary, Artistic and Scientific Property, which sought to have her father recognised as a co-composer of 18 of di Capua's songs, including ’O sole mio.  In October 2002, Maria Alvau, a judge in Turin, upheld the declaration, ruling that Mazzucchi had indeed been a legitimate co-composer of the 18 songs, because they included melodies he had composed and then sold to di Capua in June 1897, with a written authorisation for the latter to make free use of them. At the time of the decision, therefore, the melody of ’O sole mio had not yet—as had been widely supposed—entered into the public domain in any country that was a party to the Berne Convention during the relevant period. In most countries where copyright in a work lasts for 70 years after any of its authors' deaths, the melody will remain under copyright until 2042.
852	In 1949 U.S. singer Tony Martin recorded "There's No Tomorrow" with lyrics by Al Hoffman, Leo Corday, and Leon Carr, which used the melody of "’O sole mio". About ten years later, while stationed in West Germany with the U.S. Army, Elvis Presley heard the recording and put to tape a private version of the song. Upon his discharge, he requested that new lyrics be written especially for him, a job that was undertaken by the songwriting duo of Aaron Schroeder and Wally Gold, with a demo by David Hill. The rewritten version was entitled "It's Now or Never" and was a worldwide hit for Presley. When performing it in concert in the mid-1970s, Elvis would explain the origin of "It's Now Or Never" and have singer Sherrill Nielsen perform a few lines of the original Neapolitan version before commencing with his version.Vic Damone included the song in his album Angela mia (1958).Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album 101 Gang Songs (1961).
853	The festival starts at midnight on May Eve when townspeople gather outside the Golden Lion Inn to sing the "Night Song." By morning, the town has been dressed with greenery and flowers placed around the maypole. The excitement begins with the appearance of one of the 'Obby 'Osses. Male dancers cavort through the town dressed as one of two 'Obby 'Osses, the "Old" and the "Blue Ribbon" or "Methodist"  'Obby 'Osses; as the name suggests, they are stylised kinds of horses. Prodded on by acolytes known as "Teasers," each wears a mask and black frame-hung cape under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. Throughout the day, the two parades, led by the "MC" in his top hat and decorated stick, followed by a band of accordions and drums, then the 'Oss and the Teaser, with a host of people, the "Mayers" - all singing the "Morning Song." – pass along the streets of the town. Finally, late in the evening, the two 'osses meet, at the maypole, before returning to their respective stables where the crowd sings of the 'Obby 'Oss death, until its resurrection the following May Eve.
854	The festival takes place on May Day every year. It entails two separate processions that make their way around Padstow on circuits that take twelve hours to traverse. Each procession represents a different half of the town's community.Only those whose families have lived in Lowenac Padstow for at least two generations are permitted to take part in the processions.Each procession contains by an 'Obby 'Oss, a hobby horse consisting of an oval frame covered in black oilskin, which has a small horse's head in the front with a snapping jaw. This is led by an individual known as the Teaser, who is dressed in white and carries a painted club. The procession also contains a retinue of white-clad individuals, some playing accordions,melodeons and drums.
855	The custom attracted little attention outside of the town until 1907, when the folklorist Francis Etherington drew attention to it. In 1913 the folklorist Thurstan Peter wrote about it; influenced by the ideas of the anthropologist James Frazer, Peter argued that the 'Obby 'Oss custom might have once been a pre-Christian religious ritual designed to secure fertility. The idea that the custom had pre-Christian roots helped to convert it into a tourist attraction. This idea of the custom as a pre-Christian one percolated into the Padstow community, for when the historian Ronald Hutton visited the town in 1985 he found locals describing it to him as an ancient pagan fertility rite. In the 1950s Alan Lomax, then in London and working for the BBC, and his collaborator Peter Kennedy of the English Folk Dance and Song Society, decided to document the unique May Eve and May Day Festivals at Padstow, they selected George Pickow to be their cameraman. The result was the 16-minute colour film Oss Oss Wee Oss (1953).
856	By the 1990s, the 'Obby 'Oss festival was a major attraction that drew large numbers of visitors to Lowennac/Padstow. By that point, Hutton referred to it as "one of the most famous and most dramatic folk customs of modern Britain", adding that it constituted "a tremendous reaffirmation of communal pride and solidarity in this small and normally quiet settlement". The folklorist Doc Rowe, who has attended and documented the custom every year since 1963, goes further - describing 'Obby 'Oss Day as "a united proclamation - almost a 'clenched fist' in the face of time and outside influences... [it] can be seen as a communal pace-maker and, on Mayday, it recharges the community and the good fellowship of the people of Padstow." 
857	The celebration itself starts at midnight on 30 April with unaccompanied singing around the town starting at the Golden Lion Inn. By the morning of 1 May, the town is dressed with greenery, flowers and flags, with the focus being the maypole.The climax arrives when two groups of dancers progress through the town, one of each team wearing a stylised recreation of a 'horse.' The two 'osses are known as the "Old" and the "Blue Ribbon" 'osses. During the day a number of "Junior" or "colt" 'osses appear, operated by children. Accompanied by drums and accordions and led by acolytes known as "Teasers", each 'oss is adorned by a gruesome mask and black, oilskin cape on a circular frame under which they try to catch young maidens as they pass through the town. The Blue ribbon 'oss is apparently of more recent origin. In the late 19th century, Blue 'Oss was supported by members of the Temperance movement who were trying to discourage the consumption of alcohol associated with the "old" 'oss followers. After the first world war the imperative of temperance was lost, and the 'oss became known as the Peace 'Oss. Each 'oss has a "stable" (in the case of the Old 'Oss, the Golden Lion Inn and the Blue Ribbon 'Oss, the institute, from which they emerge at the start of the day's proceedings and retire at the end. Sometimes in the late afternoon, the 'osses may meet at the maypole and dance together.
858	There is documentary evidence of an 'Oss at Penzance in the late 19th century, made with a caped stick and skull, which has formed the basis of the Penglaz 'Obby 'Oss that appears during the Golowan festival and the Montol Festival, both modern revivals; the skull 'oss is strikingly similar to the Mari Lwyd in Wales associated with the pre-Christian deity Rhiannon, known as Epona the horse goddess in continental Celtic cultures, passing into festive folklore as 'the Old Grey Mare' in neighbouring parts of Britain e.g. Dartmoor (Widecombe Fair), Dorset (The Grey Mare and her Colts), as well as the Soultide mummers' horses of Cheshire.
859	While investigating a cavity within what he believes to be the base of a ruined Templar platform or altar for his colleague, Parkins finds an ancient bronze whistle with two Latin inscriptions. On one side, the Latin inscription reads "Quis est iste, qui venit?". On the other side are inscribed the letters "FLA BIS FLE FUR" in the pattern of a plus sign. Parkins pockets his find and returns to the inn, noting as he walks along the desolate beach that a "shape of indistinct personage" appears to be making great efforts to catch up with him in the distance, to no avail.
860	After an evening meal at the inn, Parkins inspects the whistle while alone in his room. He first clears the hard-packed soil from the item before reading the inscriptions, discovering the Latin inscription is Biblical; Parkins translates this as "Who is this who is coming?". He is unable to read the inscriptions on the other side of the whistle, which he then blows twice. Upon blowing the whistle, Parkins becomes aware of a sudden surge of wind outside his window as a vision of a "wide, dark expanse at night with a fresh wind blowing" enters his mind. In the middle of this vision is a solitary figure.
861	That night, Parkins dreams of a man desperately fleeing from a "bobbing, black object" along a shoreline in a state of extreme fear. In the distance, the pursuing apparition moves in a strange manner and with incredible speed. The man repeatedly clambers over high groynes in desperation before collapsing to the ground in sheer exhaustion as the object the man had been fleeing reveals itself as a figure in "pale, fluttering draperies". Each time Parkins closes his eyes, the scenario progresses, although the vision immediately vanishes when he opens his eyes. Realising he is unable to dispel the visions, Parkins decides to read himself to sleep, although when he attempts to light a match, he hears the sound of scurrying on his floor in the direction away from his bed, which he believes may be the sound of rats fleeing. Parkins then reads himself to a sound sleep, with the candle beside his bed still burning when he is woken by staff at the inn the following morning.
862	As he prepares to leave the inn, Parkins is informed by a maid that both beds in his room appeared to have been slept in. The maid had already made both beds, explaining the sheets on the bed he had not slept in were "crumpled and thrown about all ways". Parkins theorises he may have disturbed the quilt and sheets while unpacking. He then leaves the inn to play golf with an acquaintance, whom he informs of the whistle he had found at the preceptory the previous day. This acquaintance informs Parkins of his belief the whistle—which he had left in his inn room—may have belonged to Papists, and he should be wary of keeping and using the object.
863	Returning to the inn, both encounter a terrified, hyperventilating boy running from the inn who explains he has just seen a white, faceless figure behind an unlit window of a room at the inn. Both placate the boy, and resolve to investigate the matter, believing initially the child may have been the victim of a cruel prank. Upon returning to his locked room, Parkins realises that the description of the windows of the room given by the boy could only mean the child had seen the apparition in his room. He then notices that the sheets upon the room's second, unused bed are again twisted and contorted.
864	Inside Parkins's room that evening, he shows the whistle to his golfing partner, asking if he can decipher the second inscription, although his acquaintance is unable to do so. This acquaintance then leaves the room. Parkins then realises that the night ahead may be moonlit and that, as no curtains cover the windows of his room, his sleep may be disturbed by moonlight. To prevent this, he fashions a partition between his bed and the window using a rug, a stick and his umbrella. Parkins then reads for a short while before blowing out the candle beside his bed and falling asleep.
865	Approximately one hour later, Parkins is woken by the sound of his improvised device collapsing to the floor and moonlight shining on his face. He then hears a movement in the empty bed across his room. As he ponders the possibility of rats or other vermin being the source of this sound, he realises the "rattling and shaking" sounds could not be caused by rodents. Parkins then sees a figure sit up on the bed, causing him to jump from his own bed in the direction of the window, to retrieve his cane. As he does so, the "personage in the empty bed" moves into a position above the door, with arms outspread. This apparition remains stationary in the shadows for several moments as Parkins's fear escalates. The apparition then moves in a stooping posture in his direction as the draped arms feel about the room, leading Parkins to quickly determine the spectre may be blind.
866	One corner of the draperies veiling the form brushes across Parkins's face, causing Parkins to elicit a cry of fear. This cry reveals his general location to the apparition, which moves rapidly in his direction. Parkins backs against the open window of his room, screaming repeatedly as the face of the apparition is "thrust close into his own". At this moment, Parkins's friend kicks the door to his room open, just in time to see the apparition advancing towards Parkins. As he advances, the apparition disappears, and the linens which had veiled the form crumple to the floor. The following day, the whistle is thrown far into the sea.
867	'Op o' Me Thumb is a 1904 one-act play by the English authors Frederick Fenn and Richard Pryce. It was produced at the Court Theatre, London, on 13 March 1904, in a double bill with Robert Browning's A Soul's Tragedy. It transferred to the St James's Theatre on 24 April 1904. The leading role of Amanda was played by Hilda Trevelyan. The play was staged in New York in 1905 with Maude Adams as Amanda. It was filmed in 1920 as Suds, starring Mary Pickford in the role created by Trevelyan.
868	On the island of Raiatea the priests elevated the god Ta'aroa from the role of sea god - already an important function in a maritime society - to the god responsible for creating the world. A possible explanation for this is that the ariki, the hereditary chiefs and members of the highest noble ranks on Raiatea, could trace their lineage directly to Ta'aroa. A further development of this cult was the veneration of Oro, the son of Ta'aroa and Hina tu a uta, to whom the marae Taputapuatea in the Opoa valley on Raiatea is dedicated. According to tradition, Taputapuatea is the mythical birthplace of Oro. The cult of Ta'aroa also spread to the Cook Islands, the Tuamotu Archipelago and Mangareva. Large islands, such as New Zealand and Hawaii, remained unaffected by the cult and its developments and Ta'aroa retains his original function there as god of the sea. Similarly, on many of the other islands of the south Pacific Oro did not have the same superior function as on Tahiti and Raiatea.
869	Due to the growing influence of Taputapuatea - one can characterize it as a type of central pilgrimage site - Oro gained more political power and religious influence within the Polynesian pantheon. On the neighboring island of Tahiti the veneration of Oro grew in importance during the late proto-historical or early historical period and can be seen as a clear step from Polytheism to Monotheism. This development was substantially driven by the influential secret society of Arioi, who were of great religious and political importance. From within their ranks came the upper echelons of the nobility and the priesthood. The Arioi could trace the foundation of their order back to the god Oro himself.
870	According to legend Oro lived with his sisters Teouri and Oaaoa on Mount Pahia on the island of Bora Bora. He asked his sisters for help in finding a suitable wife and descended to earth on a rainbow in the guise of a warrior. His search of the various islands at first proved futile, which also saddened his sisters. In the course of their journey home to Pahia the sisters arrived in the village of Vaitape, near Vai'otaha marae on Bora Bora. There they spotted Vairaumati, a beautiful young woman bathing in a pool of water. The sisters told Oro of their encounter and he decided to make Vairaumati his wife. Vairaumati found this young, strong warrior attractive. Every morning Oro would descend to earth to meet Vairaumati and then leave again in the evening to return to Pahia.  'Oro's brothers 'Oro-tetefa and Uru-tetefa, transformed themselves into a bunch of red feathers and a pregnant sow as wedding gifts.
871	To'o was a man-made object, for example a figure made of wood or stone, that presented a figurative image of the god. On Tahiti the god Oro was presented in an effigy wrapped in coconut fibers with a mace-shaped wooden "soul" in the middle. Red and yellow feathers—the symbols of the god—were placed within the layers of coconut fiber. The To'o was stored and kept safe on the ceremonial platform and would be regularly re-clothed in tapa fiber during a complicated ceremony. This ritual possibly has to do with the local burial cult where the body would be swathed in tapa.
872	'Orrible is a British television sitcom produced by the BBC. Broadcast in 2001, it was written by and starred Johnny Vaughan. Vaughan stars as a cheeky chappy taxi-cab driver and wannabe small-time criminal in Acton (west London). Despite the BBC being confident and heavily promoting the series, it was panned by critics for the script and Vaughan's acting ability. It achieved very low viewing figures and ran for one series, and has never been repeated by the BBC. "Ultimately, it was shit" said Vaughan in a 2004 interview in The Stage. James Buckley made his acting debut playing Sean's son (and Paul's godson) in the sixth episode, Two Men and a Bastard.
873	'Ot 'n' Sweaty is the fourth album by the American rock band Cactus. It was released in 1972. Original members Jim McCarty and Rusty Day had left the group, so bass guitarist Tim Bogert and drummer Carmine Appice were joined by Werner Fritzschings on guitar, Duane Hitchings on keyboards and Peter French (ex-Leaf Hound and Atomic Rooster) on vocals. This was the band's final album before their long hiatus that lasted until 2006. The first three songs (filled up the first side of the original LP) were recorded live on April 3, 1972, in Puerto Rico at the Mar Y Sol Pop Festival, and the rest (the second side of the LP) were recorded in studio (so on the album's front cover is pointed after the band's name: On Stage In Puerto Rico And In The Studio). The pinnacle tracks for this album are "Bad Stuff", "Bringing Me Down", "Bedroom Mazurka", "Telling You" and a live recording of "Let Me Swim", which was a song by the original Cactus on their 1970 debut album[1].
874	The dish is known as kokoda in Fiji, oka in Samoa, ika mata in the Cook Islands and New Zealand, and simply poisson cru on the French islands. The word "ota" means "raw" in Samoan, Tongan, and Tahitian, although the more common term for the dish in French Polynesia is its French equivalent, "poisson cru" (literally, "raw fish"). Any type of seafood can be used to make "ota," the word "ika" means fish ("i'a" in Samoan language), but the dish is often prepared with mussels ("ota pipi/maso"), prawns ("ota ulavai"), crab ("ota pa'a/paka"), lobster ("ota ula"), octopus/squid ("ota fe'e/feke"), sea urchin ("ota vana/tuitui"), and eel ("ota pusi").
875	Pataphysics was a concept expressed by Jarry in a mock-scientific manner, with undertones of spoofing and quackery, as expounded in his novel Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician. Here, Jarry toyed with conventional concepts and interpretations of reality. Another attempt at a definition interprets 'pataphysics as an idea that "the virtual or imaginary nature of things as glimpsed by the heightened vision of poetry or science or love can be seized and lived as real". Jarry defines 'pataphysics in a number of statements and examples, including that it is "the science of imaginary solutions, which symbolically attributes the properties of objects, described by their virtuality, to their lineaments". A practitioner of 'pataphysics is a pataphysician or a pataphysicist.
876	Pataphysics "the science of the particular" does not, therefore, study the rules governing the general recurrence of a periodic incident (the expected case) so much as study the games governing the special occurrence of a sporadic accident (the excepted case). [...] Jarry performs humorously on behalf of literature what Nietzsche performs seriously on behalf of philosophy. Both thinkers in effect attempt to dream up a "gay science" whose joie de vivre thrives wherever the tyranny of truth has increased our esteem for the lie and wherever the tyranny of reason has increased our esteem for the mad.
877	Jarry mandated the inclusion of the apostrophe in the orthography, 'pataphysique and 'pataphysics, "...to avoid a simple pun". The words pataphysician or pataphysicist and the adjective pataphysical should not include the apostrophe. Only when consciously referring to Jarry's science itself should the word 'pataphysics carry the apostrophe. The term pataphysics is a paronym (considered a kind of pun in French) of metaphysics. Since the apostrophe in no way affects the meaning or pronunciation of pataphysics, this spelling of the term is a sly notation, to the reader, suggesting a variety of puns that listeners may hear, or be aware of. These puns include patte à physique ("physics paw"), as interpreted by Jarry scholars Keith Beaumont and Roger Shattuck, pas ta physique ("not your physics"), and pâte à physique ("physics paste").
878	As Jarry claimed that 'pataphysics existed "...as far from metaphysics as metaphysics extends from regular reality", a pataphor attempts to create a figure of speech that exists as far from metaphor as metaphor exists from non-figurative language. Whereas a metaphor compares a real object or event to a seemingly unrelated subject to emphasize their similarities, the pataphor uses the newly created metaphorical similarity as a reality on which to base itself. In going beyond mere ornamentation of the original idea, the pataphor seeks to describe a new and separate world, in which an idea or aspect has taken on a life of its own.
879	In The Disappearance of Literature: Blanchot, Agamben, and the Writers of the No, Aaron Hillyer writes: "While metaphysics and metaphors attain one degree of separation from reality, pataphors and pataphysics move beyond by two degrees. This allows an idea to assume its own life, a sort of plasticity freed from the harness of rigid representation. In other words, metaphors operate on the level of the same. They juxtapose apparently unrelated material in order to draw out subtle identities. Pataphors unsettle this mechanism; they use the facade of metaphorical similarity as a basis for establishing an entirely new range of references and outlandish articulations: a new world in the midst of the old, the novel taking to the streets. Just as Kafka sought to forge a new form of life on the basis of absolute separation from historical progress, on cultural 'intransmissibility', and just as Blanchot pursued the 'pure novel' that exists in a relationship of absolute refusal of the established world, so the pataphysician seeks to initiate a new world on the grounds of a tenuous unreality."
880	'Prosperous' British India, more completely titled Prosperous' British India: A Revelation from Official Records, was a book published in 1901 by British author William Digby that described the economic conditions prevailing in British India in the latter half of the nineteenth century under British rule. It used official government statistics to illuminate the falling incomes and increasing impoverishment in India under British administration during that period. The book was influential and, at the time, attracted attention due to the imprinting of the actual falling per-capita income statistics in gold on the spine of the book itself. The book also used government statistics to demonstrate that the death-toll and frequency of catastrophic economic disasters in India, such as famines, was growing systematically under British rule.
881	At the Newport Jazz Festival in 1955, Davis performed the song "'Round Midnight" as part of an all-star jam session, with the song's composer Thelonious Monk, along with Connie Kay and Percy Heath of the Modern Jazz Quartet, Zoot Sims, and Gerry Mulligan. Davis's solo received a positive reception from many jazz fans and critics. His response to this performance was typically laconic: "What are they talking about? I just played the way I always play." George Avakian of Columbia Records was in the audience, and his brother Aram persuaded him that he ought to sign Davis to the label.
882	Davis signed with Columbia and formed his "first great quintet" with John Coltrane on saxophone. 'Round About Midnight was his first album for the label. He was still under contract to Prestige, but he had an agreement that he could record material for Columbia to release after the expiration of his Prestige contract. Recording took place at Columbia studios; the first session was on October 26, 1955 at Studio D, during which the track "Ah-Leu-Cha" was recorded with three numbers that did not appear on the album. This is the first studio recording of the quintet. The remainder of the album was recorded during sessions on June 5, 1956 ("Dear Old Stockholm", "Bye Bye Blackbird" and "Tadd's Delight") and September 10, 1956 ("All of You" and the titular "'Round Midnight") at Columbia's 30th Street Studio. During the same period, the Miles Davis Quintet was also recording sessions to fulfill its contract with Prestige.
883	On April 17, 2001, Sony reissued the album on compact disc for its Columbia/Legacy label with 24-bit audio remastering and four previously released bonus tracks from the initial sessions. "Budo" had been released as part of the 1957 anthology album on Columbia, Jazz Omnibus, and "Sweet Sue, Just You" had appeared on the 1956 album by Leonard Bernstein explaining jazz to the classical audience, What Is Jazz. A two-disc reissue of June 14, 2005, included the 2001 reissue with a second disc containing Davis' 1955 Newport Jazz Festival performance of "'Round Midnight", along with a recording of the quintet's set from the 1956 Pacific Jazz Festival. The Newport track had been released for the first time the previous year on the Legacy compilation Happy Birthday Newport: 50 Swinging Years!
884	In his five-star review in the May 16, 1957 issue of DownBeat magazine, Ralph J. Gleason called the album "modern jazz conceived and executed in the very best style." Ralph Berton of The Record Changer called the album "orthodox, middle-of-the-road conservative progressive jazz." The Penguin Guide to Jazz said it "sounds like a footnote" to the Prestige contractual obligation sessions (Miles, Relaxin', Workin', Steamin', and Cookin') and that "the material is fine but somehow fails to cast quite the consistent spell which the Prestige recordings do." Bob Rusch of Cadence wrote, "everything about this date, from the black-and-white cover photo, washed in red, of Miles Davis, removed in thought behind dark glasses, to the performances, is classic. Not surprisingly, careful packaging and exquisite artistry have created a legend and, in this case, one of the essential recordings in the history of recorded music."
885	It is thought that Monk composed the song sometime in 1940 or 1941. However, Harry Colomby claims that Monk may have written an early version around 1936 (at the age of 19). The song was copyrighted September 24, 1943 in C minor under the title "I Need You So", and included lyrics by Monk himself. The first recording was made by Cootie Williams on August 22, 1944, after the pianist Bud Powell persuaded Williams to record the tune. Monk first recorded the song on November 21, 1947, and later appeared on the Blue Note album Genius of Modern Music: Volume 1, and recorded it several times after that. His first version was transcribed by Lionel Grigson in A Thelonious Monk Study Album (Novello, 1993).
886	Jazz trumpeters Cootie Williams and Dizzy Gillespie further embellished the song, with songwriter Bernie Hanighen adding his own lyrics. The lyrics were copyrighted November 27, 1944 under the title "Grand Finale". Both Williams and Hanighen received co-credits for their contributions. The commonly played intro to "'Round Midnight" was originally composed by Dizzy Gillespie for the end of his arrangement for "I Can't Get Started", but later adopted it to the intro for "'Round Midnight". Gillespie later reused the arrangement for "I Can't Get Started", and recorded it for Birks' Works and Something Old, Something New.
887	The song is sometimes incorrectly called "'Round About Midnight", as Miles Davis used this as the title of his 1957 Columbia Records album 'Round About Midnight that included a version based on Dizzy Gillespie's arrangement. It became a signature song for Davis; his performance of it with Monk at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival, which was heard by producer George Avakian, was crucial in securing him a recording contract with Columbia Records. He had previously recorded the song in the studio two other times, once for Prestige in 1953 and again in 1956 as released on Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants.
888	"'Round Springfield" is the 22nd episode of The Simpsons' sixth season. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 30, 1995. In the episode, Bart is hospitalized after eating a piece of jagged metal in his Krusty-O's cereal and sues Krusty the Clown. While visiting Bart, Lisa discovers her old mentor, jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, is also in the hospital. When he dies suddenly, she resolves to honor his memory. Steve Allen (as himself) and Ron Taylor (as Bleeding Gums Murphy) guest star, each in their second appearance on the show. Dan Higgins also returns as the writer and performer of all of Lisa and Bleeding Gums' saxophone solos.
889	The episode was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia — based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss — and was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Jean and Reiss, who were previously the series' showrunners, returned to produce this episode (as well as "A Star Is Burns") to ease the workload of the show's regular staff. They worked on it alongside the staff of The Critic, the series they had left The Simpsons to create. The episode marks the series' first time that a recurring character was killed off, something the staff had considered for a while. The episode features numerous cultural references, including Carole King's song "Jazzman", the actor James Earl Jones and the Kimba the White Lion/The Lion King controversy.
890	Bart gets a stomach ache after accidentally eating a jagged metal Krusty-O prize packed in his breakfast cereal. Thinking Bart is feigning illness to avoid a history test, Homer and Marge send him to school anyway. After Bart struggles through the test, Mrs. Krabappel allows him to visit the school nurse once she sees he actually may be ill. Bart collapses in the nurse's office and is taken to Springfield General Hospital, where he undergoes appendicitis surgery from Dr. Hibbert and Dr. Nick. While visiting Bart in the hospital, Lisa discovers her hero, jazzman Bleeding Gums Murphy, is a patient in another ward. He is destitute after spending all the royalties from his only album, Sax on the Beach, on a $1500-a-day Fabergé egg habit.
891	Bart's classmates admire his scar and demand to have appendectomies of their own. Lisa spends time with Murphy, who lends her his saxophone for a school recital. With most of the orchestra absent while recovering from appendix surgery, the remaining trio perform and Lisa is a hit with the crowd. She is saddened to learn that Bleeding Gums has died when she returns to the hospital the next day. Lisa is the only person who attends his funeral, where Reverend Lovejoy misidentifies him as a sousaphone player. Lisa vows to make sure that everyone in Springfield appreciates Bleeding Gums' musical legacy. Bart sues Krusty the Clown and is given a $100,000 settlement. After Bart's attorney Lionel Hutz deducts his legal fees, Bart is left with only $500.
892	Still stricken with grief, Lisa decides that the best way to honor Bleeding Gums' memory is by having his album played on the local jazz station. Lisa spots it at the Android's Dungeon for $250; after hearing that Bleeding Gums is dead, Comic Book Guy doubles the price to $500. As she leaves, Bart arrives with his $500 settlement to buy a pog with Steve Allen's face. After seeing his sister's sad face through the shop window, Bart buys Lisa the album because she was the only one who believed his stomach ache was real. When she says he will never again see $500, Bart shows her a box of new Krusty-Os with flesh-eating bacteria which he intends to eat and sue Krusty again with.
893	When the radio station plays one of Bleeding Gums' songs, Lisa is disappointed because the station's tiny range prevents anyone from hearing it. Lightning strikes the antenna, giving it extra power and projecting it into every radio in Springfield. She is satisfied and turns to leave, but Bleeding Gums appears from the heavens to tell Lisa that she has made "an old jazz man happy". Mufasa from The Lion King, Darth Vader from the Star Wars film series, and James Earl Jones then appear in the clouds alongside Bleeding Gums, who tells them to keep quiet. After saying their final goodbyes, Lisa and Bleeding Gums perform "Jazzman" one last time.
894	"'Round Springfield" was written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, based on a story idea by Al Jean and Mike Reiss. It was the first episode directed by Steven Dean Moore. Due to Fox's demand for 24 to 25 episodes per season, which the production staff found impossible to meet, two episodes of each season were written and produced by former showrunners, to relieve the stress on The Simpsons' writing staff. Jean and Reiss, who were showrunners for the show's third and fourth seasons, returned to produce this episode, as well as "A Star Is Burns", instead of the season's main showrunner David Mirkin. On both episodes, they were aided by the staff of The Critic, the show the two left The Simpsons to create. Sternin and Ventimilia were writers on The Critic and were big fans of The Simpsons, so were thrilled to be able to write an episode.
895	This episode marked the first time a recurring character has been killed off on the show. The writers and production team felt that it would be a good, emotional storyline, which, through Lisa, could focus on the theme of grief. They decided that it could not be one of the main characters; Jean joked that "we wouldn't want it to be someone like Mr. Burns, that we'd obviously want to see in the show again". Eventually, Jean decided on Bleeding Gums Murphy, a character introduced in the season one episode "Moaning Lisa"; a flashback to "Moaning Lisa" is featured in the episode. Murphy was a fairly minor character, only appearing in a couple of episodes, but he appeared in the show's opening sequence and remained there after this episode, until the opening was re-designed in season 20. Moore's first ever job on the show was in the animation department for "Moaning Lisa" so he "appreciated" being able to direct this episode. Reiss stated, "I had been polling for years to kill Marge's mom but this was a better idea". Actor Ron Taylor returned to guest star as Murphy in the episode. Comedian Steve Allen also made his second guest appearance on the show, having previously appeared in the episode "Separate Vocations".
896	The episode contains numerous references to popular culture. The title is a play on both the jazz standard 'Round Midnight by Thelonious Monk and the similarly named film also about an unappreciated jazz musician. When a deceased Bleeding Gums Murphy appears to Lisa in a cloud towards the end of the episode, he is joined by Darth Vader, Mufasa, and James Earl Jones. Although all three roles were originally portrayed by Jones, the characters in this scene were impersonated by cast member Harry Shearer; Jones himself guest starred twice previously. Additionally, Mufasa accidentally mentions "Kimba" and corrects himself by saying "Simba". This is a reference to the debate regarding The Lion King's resemblance to the anime Kimba the White Lion. Lisa and Bleeding Gums play Carole King's song "Jazzman" in this scene and in the hospital earlier in the episode. Bleeding Gums has to leave at the end of the scene because he has a date with the jazz singer Billie Holiday.
897	Additionally, Homer has a Starland Vocal Band tattoo on his arm, Bart considers buying a Steve Allen "ultimate pog", and the music heard just before Bart's operation is a parody of the theme music of ER. Bleeding Gums appears on an episode of The Cosby Show, a reference to Bill Cosby often getting jazz musicians he liked to appear on the show; in the episode, Cosby is voiced by The Simpsons regular Dan Castellaneta. Lionel Hutz's "crack team of lawyers", Robert Shaporo and Albert Dershman, are parodies of Robert Shapiro and Alan Dershowitz, two of the defense attorneys at the O. J. Simpson murder case. The three drive away in a white pickup truck, similar to the Ford Bronco that Al Cowlings and O.J. Simpson drove in their televised low-speed pursuit before Simpson's arrest.
898	In the episode, budget cuts at Springfield Elementary School force the janitor Groundskeeper Willie to be used as a French teacher. Expressing his disdain for the French, he exclaims to his class: "Bonjourrrrr, you cheese-eatin' surrender monkeys." The quote, particularly the phrase "cheese-eating surrender monkeys", has since entered wider use. It was used particularly in the run-up to the war in Iraq, having been popularized by the conservative National Review journalist Jonah Goldberg, to describe European and especially French opposition to military action. A piece in The Guardian noted that the phrase was "made acceptable in official diplomatic channels around the globe". Ben Macintyre has written that the phrase is "perhaps the most famous" of the show's coinages and since Goldberg's usage it "has gone on to become a journalistic cliché".
899	It has subsequently been used by the New York Post (as "Surrender Monkeys") as the headline for its December 7, 2006, front page, referring to the Iraq Study Group and its recommendation that U.S. soldiers be withdrawn from Iraq by early 2008. The Daily Telegraph has cited it in relation to Anglo-French military cooperation. The term has been used in books by commentator Laura Ingraham, and academics Stuart Croft, Stephen Chan, and Paul L. Moorcraft and Philip M. Taylor. Ned Sherrin included the quote in the Oxford Dictionary of Humorous Quotations; it was introduced in the third edition in 2005. It is also included in the Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations. Douglas Coupland's 2009 novel Generation A refers to Groundskeeper Willie's use of the phrase.
900	The song continues the story about the fictitious truck convoy from the song "Convoy".  The truckers cross to Europe (there ain't no way out 'cept for that one Atlantic Ocean) and travel through several countries including Great Britain, Germany, Russia, and Japan.  At the end of the song there is also a reference to Australia (Ah, ten-four, Pig Pen, what's your twenty? Australia? Mercy sakes, ain't nothin' down there but Tasmanian devils and them cue-walla bears.).  The lyrics consist of different types of interspersed dialog including simulated CB conversations with CB slang and the chorus sung with a pirate accent and self-mocking background vocals (Dumb, Dumb, Dumb, This is,).  The song's CB dialog includes parodied British, German, Russian, and Japanese accents, with typically mispronounced words.
901	'S Make It (slang for 'Let's go') is a recording by the hard bop Art Blakey jazz ensemble. It was recorded in Los Angeles in 1964 and issued on the Limelight label. Following the departure of stars from his 1961 to 1964 band, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter and Cedar Walton, it includes previous Blakey alumni and newer players. This was trombonist Curtis Fuller's last recording as a regular member of the group, though he would return to record sporadically with Blakey in the 1970s and 80s.  The album was re-released on Verve in 2004.
902	Jeffery S. McMillan has called the release one of Blakey's most underrated works and that it exemplifies his 1964–1965 work. In a review in the December 1965 issue of Black World, the title track is described as "a diabolical concept, a dark image, invoking the innermost caverns of Manhattan." David Rickert calls the album "a fine Messengers album and a good example of the drummer's consistently satisfying work." Russ Musto referred to the release as a "return to a more soulful sound". Ken Dryden stated in his Allmusic review that "It's a shame that this was the only recording by this particular lineup of the Jazz Messengers, as [John] Gilmore's strong blowing complements Morgan very well".
903	Fortunately Eddie has brought along a delicious packet of chocolate HobNobs, which he refuses to share with Richie. A fight breaks out and the biscuits end up being flung into a nearby polluted pond. While drying some of the wet HobNobs over a fire they debate the existence (and edibility) of Wombles; when Eddie spots a hedgehog (which he believes to be Great Uncle Bulgaria) the two try to kill it using a tent pole as a blowgun with pub darts as missiles. When Richie is hit by the darts instead he demands the blowgun from Eddie so he can exact revenge. However, he only worsens his situation by swallowing a dart after blowing inwards. When Eddie manages to get it out and the dart once again hits Richie, Richie becomes enraged and throws it into the polluted pond.
904	Richie finds and divides a fish with the dart from the pond, but Eddie refuses to eat his half. Richie cooks his half and eats it, but declares it "disgusting!" Eddie produces some Scotch and downs the lot, drinking himself into a stupor. As Richie muses how nothing interesting or exciting happens in the countryside, a mad man (credited as "Mr. Tent") runs up to them cackling manically, flashes at them and flees, still guffawing. Richie is taken aback and begins to wonder why people even bother to do it "with something as small as that". He then decides to retire to the tent for a sleep.
905	Later at night at Richie's request, Eddie ties Richie tighter into his sleeping bag as a storm begins to brew outside. An owl hoots, frightening Richie who fears that there is some dark and evil force lurking in the night, waiting to consume them. Eddie responds that it is "the fish repeating on you". The two begin to hear more noises, which Eddie believes are the Wombles coming to get them. Eddie attempts to build a fire in the tent to ward them off, only to cause an explosion that burns his and Richie's faces. As the storm continues, a dark shadow appears creeping outside the tent. Richie tells Eddie to help him out of his sleeping bag so they can flee, but there is no time. Eddie zips the tent closed and they both watch with fright as it slowly starts unzipping again. It is revealed to be the flasher from before, who grabs the tent and thrusts his genitals inside. Richie and Eddie scream, and Eddie quickly zips the tent back up, catching the man's genitals in the zip. The flasher screams in agony and runs off, taking the whole tent wrapped around his genitals with him. Eddie decides to leave, but Richie cannot get out of his sleeping bag. Before leaving, Eddie knocks Richie out with a tent mallet.
906	Although now generally referred to as episode six of the second series, this episode did not air in the UK for almost three years after it was made. On 15 July 1992, following the episode's production, Rachel Nickell was murdered on Wimbledon Common. As the episode was set there, the BBC accordingly decided to withhold domestic transmission for reasons of sensitivity. It was, however, included in overseas sales packages, and was screened in New Zealand in 1993. The episode was released on video in the UK that same year, and was finally broadcast there on 10 April 1995, two months after the end of the third series - making it the last episode of the entire Bottom run to be aired.
907	As the episode begins, Richie is trying to enjoy an English Sunday morning, while Eddie is trying to watch what he believes are pornographic videos. After Eddie has forced Richie to sit down to watch the film, the pair observe that the film is not particularly erotic and Richie suggests that the "Furry Honey-pot Adventure" is probably a kids film. Eddie's other purchases also turn out to be innocent - "Big Jugs" is a history of Victorian pottery and "Swedish Lesbians in Blackcurrant Jam" is actually "Swedish Legends in Blackcurrant Jam Making". Eddie was disappointed that he spent an hour choosing some wrong videos and ruining his own Sunday entertainment. At this point, the landlord Mr. Harrison bursts into the flat asking Richie and Eddie if they would mind his shop, as he must deal with his mother's "stupid bloody funeral!".
908	In the shop, Richie demands to wear a white overcoat and make Eddie his assistant by wearing a brown coat. But Mr Harrison doesn't have one, so Richie tells Eddie to put his jacket on "back-to-front" so customers can see that Eddie is merely his assistant (there was no "assistant" name tag). Mr Harrison leaves and Richie engrosses himself in the role of shopkeeper, while Eddie empties all the packets of Hula Hoops that Richard repeatedly crushes with the counter flap. Richie goes on bizarre nationalist rants, repeatedly insisting that British things are 'best in the world', and is extremely rude to every customer who enters the shop. First, Richie insults a friend of Eddie's who came to complain that his newspaper was not delivered. The customer wants to take the newspaper Richie is reading and beats Richie's head against the counter when Richie argues with him. (Richie timidly calls him a "thug" after he leaves, to which Eddie responds, "British thugs, best in the world!")
909	Later, an old woman in the shop hears Richie talking to himself and inquires if he is mad, to which Richie responds by threatening to punch her. Then a doctor arrives to buy three bottles of champagne, but makes Richie angry when he calls him "assistant." Richie is in desperation with the state of the nation when Eddie suggests they go up to the roof and watch cricket. Eddie sets up a bell on the door so they know when people are entering the shop. Richie refuses to watch the cricket because he feels responsible for watching the shop, but then changes his mind when the same little old woman comes back with her big tattooed son who punches Richie in the face for threatening her.
910	On the roof, the pair chat and watch the cricket game before Eddie hears the bell and goes downstairs to serve a customer. Richie sets a trap for Eddie by sabotaging his deckchair, then he realizes that the roof flap cannot be opened from the outside and panics before Eddie opens the flap, hitting Richie in the face. Eddie then helps Richie to the booby-trapped chair and Richie injures himself further. When Eddie goes down to serve another customer Richie sets another trap with Eddie's favourite sandwich, pickled onion, where the trap door will smash Eddie's head. The plan backfires again and the hatch shuts, trapping both of them on the roof. People start looting the shop and Eddie climbs down the drainpipe to stop them. Richie has removed the string that holds the pipe to the roof, so the pipe collapses to the ground with Eddie on it. Eddie does manage to stop the looting and returns to the roof. As soon as Eddie gets back up, the door slams shut and it begins to rain. The episode ends with Richie punching Eddie off the roof.
911	Other vocal versions include those of Bing Crosby (recorded in 1954 for use on his radio show and it was subsequently included in the box set The Bing Crosby CBS Radio Recordings (1954-56) issued by Mosaic Records (catalog MD7-245) in 2009.), Brian Wilson, Anita O'Day, Gene Kelly, Ella Fitzgerald (for her album Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Song Book), Michael Feinstein (for his album Pure Gershwin), Judy Garland, Joe Williams, John Pizzarelli, Sarah Vaughan, Karrin Allyson, Diana Krall for her album The Look of Love and as a duet with Tony Bennett on their collaborative album Love Is Here to Stay, João Gilberto, Shirley Bassey, Harry Connick Jr. and Engelbert Humperdinck.
912	 'S gibt nur a Kaiserstadt, 's gibt nur a Wien!  is a polka written by Johann Strauss II in 1864. The title of this polka was inspired from the waltz duet in the Singspiel (musical comedy) Aline by Adolf Bäuerle with music by Wenzel Müller first performed at the Theater in der Leopoldstadt on 9 October 1822. The song titled 'Was macht denn der Prater' was a hit during its day whereas its refrain 'Ja nur ein' Kaiserstadt, ja nur a Wien' (Yes, only one Imperial City, yes only one Vienna!) became a popular household phrase.
913	While Stauss adapts no music from the stage work, he did incorporate Haydn's Austrian Hymn 'Gott erhalte' into the Finale of the polka. Strauss first performed the work during a lucrative Russian tour at Pavlovsk where he frequently performed at the Vauxhall Pavilion. At his penultimate concert there on 8 October 1864 (Russian calendar 26 September), he performed the work under its original title 'Vergiß mein nicht' (Forget me Not). For his audiences back home in Vienna, he retitled the work and performed it on 4 December 1864 at a festive concert at the Vienna Volksgarten to celebrate his 20th anniversary of his public début at Dommayer's Casino.
914	'Salem's Lot is a 1975 horror novel  by American author Stephen King. It was his second published novel. The story involves a writer named Ben Mears who returns to the town of Jerusalem's Lot (or 'Salem's Lot for short) in Maine, where he lived from the age of five through nine, only to discover that the residents are becoming vampires. The town is revisited in the short stories "Jerusalem's Lot" and "One for the Road", both from King's story collection Night Shift (1978). The novel was nominated for the World Fantasy Award in 1976 and the Locus Award for the All-Time Best Fantasy Novel in 1987.
915	In two separate interviews in the 1980s, King said that, of all his books, 'Salem's Lot was his favorite. In his June 1983 Playboy interview, the interviewer mentioned that because it was his favorite, King was planning a sequel, but King has said on his website that because The Dark Tower series already continued the narrative in Wolves of the Calla and Song of Susannah, he felt there was no longer a need for a sequel. In 1987 he told Phil Konstantin in The Highway Patrolman magazine: "In a way it is my favorite story, mostly because of what it says about small towns. They are kind of a dying organism right now. The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!"
916	Ben Mears, a writer who spent part of his childhood in Jerusalem's Lot, Maine, has returned in 1975 after 25 years to try to write his next novel. He quickly becomes friends with high-school teacher Matt Burke and strikes up a passionate romantic relationship with Susan Norton, a young college graduate with ambitions of leaving Jerusalem's Lot and heading to New York. Ben has returned to the town to write a book about the long-abandoned Marsten House, where he had a bad experience as a child where he saw a hanging ghost. Mears learns that the house—the former home of Depression-era hitman Hubert "Hubie" Marsten—has been purchased by Kurt Barlow, ostensibly an Austrian immigrant who has arrived in the Lot to open an antique furniture store. Barlow is supposedly on an extended buying trip; only his business partner, Richard Straker, is seen in public. The truth, however, is that Barlow is an ancient vampire, and Straker is his human familiar.
917	The duo's arrival coincides with the disappearance of a young boy, Ralphie Glick, and the death of his 12-year-old brother, Danny, who becomes the town's first vampire turned by Barlow. Barlow also turns town dump custodian Dud Rogers and telephone repairman Corey Bryant. Danny turns other locals into vampires, including the graveyard digger, Mike Ryerson; a newborn baby, Randy McDougall; a man named, Jack Griffen; and even Danny's own mother, Marjorie Glick. Danny fails, however, to turn his classmate Mark Petrie, who resists him successfully by holding a plastic cross in Danny's face. Mark is obsessed with Hollywood movie monsters and knows that you're not supposed to invite vampires inside of your home, which helps him stay safe.
918	When Father Callahan and Mark head over to Mark's parents' house to explain the danger that the family is in, the power is suddenly cut off, and Barlow appears. After killing Mark's parents by smashing their heads together, Barlow briefly takes the boy hostage. Callahan pulls out his cross in an attempt to drive him off, and for a time, it works until Barlow challenges him to throw the cross away. Callahan, not having faith enough to do so, is soon overwhelmed by Barlow, who takes the now-useless cross and snaps it in two. Barlow then forces Callahan to drink his vampire blood, making him "unclean". When Callahan tries to re-enter his church, he receives an electric shock, preventing him from going inside. Callahan then leaves Jerusalem's Lot.
919	Jimmy is killed when he falls from a rigged staircase and is impaled by knives set up by the vampires. Ben and Mark succeed in destroying the master vampire Barlow, but are lucky to escape with their lives and are forced to leave the town to the now-leaderless vampires. The pair also took Jimmy’s body with them to bury in a safe place, to prevent Jimmy’s body from falling into the vampires' hands. The novel's prologue, which is set shortly after the end of the story proper, describes Ben and Mark's flight across the country to a seaside town in Mexico, where they attempt to recover from their ordeal. Mark is received into the Catholic Church by a friendly local priest and confesses for the first time what they have experienced. The epilogue has the two returning to the town a year later, intending to renew the battle. Ben, knowing that there are too many hiding places for the vampires, deliberately starts a brush fire in the woods near the town with the intent of destroying both it and the Marsten House once and for all.
920	While teaching a high school Fantasy and Science Fiction course at Hampden Academy, King was inspired by Dracula, one of the books covered in the class. "One night over supper I wondered aloud what would happen if Dracula came back in the twentieth century, to America. 'He'd probably be run over by a Yellow Cab on Park Avenue and killed,' my wife said. (In the Introduction to the 2004 audiobook recording that Stephen King read himself, he says it was he who said, "Probably he'd land in New York and be killed by a Taxi Cab, like Margaret Mitchell in Atlanta" and that it was his wife who suggested a rural setting for the book.) That closed the discussion, but in the following days, my mind kept returning to the idea. It occurred to me that my wife was probably right – if the legendary Count came to New York, that is. But if he were to show up in a sleepy little country town, what then? I decided I wanted to find out, so I wrote 'Salem's Lot, which was originally titled Second Coming."  Though King initially planned to title the novel Second Coming, he changed it to Jerusalem's Lot on the advice of his wife, novelist Tabitha King, who thought the original title sounded too much like a "bad sex story." King's publishers then shortened it to the current title, thinking the author's choice sounded too religious. King's paperback publisher bought the book for $550,000.
921	King expands on this thought of the 20th-century vampire in his essay for Adeline Magazine, "On Becoming a Brand Name" (February 1980): "I began to turn the idea over in my mind, and it began to coalesce into a possible novel. I thought it would make a good one, if I could create a fictional town with enough prosaic reality about it to offset the comic-book menace of a bunch of vampires."  Yet the inspirations for 'Salem's Lot go back even farther. In Danse Macabre, a non-fiction overview of the modern horror genre, King recalls a dream he had when he was eight years old. In the dream, he saw the body of a hanged man dangling from the arm of a scaffold on a hill. "The corpse bore a sign: ROBERT BURNS. But when the wind caused the corpse to turn in the air, I saw that it was my face - rotted and picked by birds, but obviously mine. And then the corpse opened its eyes and looked at me. I woke up screaming, sure that a dead face would be leaning over me in the dark. Sixteen years later, I was able to use the dream as one of the central images in my novel 'Salem's Lot. I just changed the name of the corpse to Hubie Marsten."
922	I wrote 'Salem's Lot during the period when the Ervin committee was sitting. That was also the period when we first learned of the Ellsberg break-in, the White House tapes, the connection between Gordon Liddy and the CIA, the news of enemies lists, and other fearful intelligence. During the spring, summer and fall of 1973, it seemed that the Federal Government had been involved in so much subterfuge and so many covert operations that, like the bodies of the faceless wetbacks that Juan Corona was convicted of slaughtering in California, the horror would never end ... Every novel is to some extent an inadvertent psychological portrait of the novelist, and I think that the unspeakable obscenity in 'Salem's Lot has to do with my own disillusionment and consequent fear for the future. In a way, it is more closely related to Invasion of the Body Snatchers than it is to Dracula. The fear behind 'Salem's Lot seems to be that the Government has invaded everybody.
923	In 2005, Centipede Press released a deluxe limited edition of 'Salem's Lot with black and white photographs by Jerry Uelsmann and the two short stories "Jerusalem's Lot" and "One for the Road", as well as over 50 pages of deleted material. The book was limited to 315 copies, each signed by Stephen King and Jerry Uelsmann. The book was printed on 100# Mohawk Superfine paper, it measured 9 by 13 inches (23 cm × 33 cm), was over 4+1⁄4 in (11 cm) thick, and weighed more than 13 pounds (5.9 kg). The book included a ribbon marker, head and tail bands, three-piece cloth construction, and a slipcase. An unsigned hardcover edition limited to 600 copies, was later released. Both the signed and unsigned editions were sold out. In an interview with the printed trade journal Fine Books & Collections, King said of the illustrated folio version of his 'Salem's Lot, "I think it's beautiful!" A trade edition was later released.
924	It garnered high ratings most especially in provinces and cities where ABS-CBN had superior signal. But the real challenge for "Sang Linggo" was the show's content itself as it tried to veer away from the usual noontime format of slapstick humor and various talent portions that its predecessor (and now competitor on GMA Network) Eat Bulaga!" (which added Allan K., Francis Magalona, Jose Manalo, Donna Cruz, and others to its roster of hosts as well) had presented to its viewers.  Eventually, the show decided to compete for viewership by coming up with various game and talent portions as their answer to their rival show's own tried and tested segments. Among the portions that were a hit to its viewers on its initial year were "Conan the Beautician", "Hibangers", "Pop-Pinoyan", and "Princess Asia".
925	In the show's second year, it launched "Calendar Girl", a pageant segment for girls aged 15–21 years old. The segment injected a "sexy" element to the show but won over a new fanbase. The noontime show also introduced "Barangay APO", a segment where host Eagle Riggs goes on live remote telecast on a selected barangay and gives out many prizes in cash and kind. The said segment catapulted 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila to the number 1 spot in the noontime slot in Mega Manila. But the show's popularity declined when Eat Bulaga! introduced "Super SiReyna", a transgender pageant.  Due to "Super SiReyna"'s phenomenal success in 1996, it catapulted Eat Bulaga! back to the top spot as well as other new segments that capture the attention of its viewers.
926	 'Sang Linggo nAPO Sila barely celebrated its third year on Philippine TV when the show suddenly suffered in the ratings game. The show was moved to Studio 3 of ABS-CBN Broadcast Center at that time in 1997. With Eat Bulaga! continuing to thrill the noontime viewing public with "Super SiReyna", "Kaserola ng Kabayanan", and "Philippine Bulaga Association", the staff decided to give its still-popular segment "Calendar Girl" a more bolder, naughtier approach. The question-and-answer portion was now handled by the newly established trio of John Estrada, Randy Santiago and Willie Revillame. Their delivery of naughty jokes on national TV was met with mixed reactions. At the same time, the show unveiled its own game portion "APO Cash ng Bayan" which gave out many cash prizes. The ratings improved a bit with the changes but it reportedly did not sit well with some of the original hosts of the show. The show was in danger of cancellation and went its final airing on November 28, 1998, when co-hosts Randy Santiago, John Estrada and Willie Revillame went on to become the main hosts of the network's new noontime show Magandang Tanghali Bayan that aired Mondays to Fridays. The APO Hiking Society, on the other hand, kept the Saturday noontime slot via the musical variety show "Sabado Live". However with "MTB" posting higher ratings after adding the phenomenal segment "Pera o Bayong" later before the year ended, ABS-CBN management decided to cancel "Sabado Live" and extend "MTB"'s run to Saturday. "Sabado Live"'s final show aired on February 27, 1999.
927	Declan Desmond, an opinionated British documentary film producer, films a documentary at Springfield Elementary School on the students' lives. He interviews Bart as he gets hit by a ball of dirt thrown by Nelson and breaks down in tears. Later, Declan belittles Lisa as she talks about the multiplicity of her interests, insinuating that she could neither be happy nor successful juggling too many hobbies or passions. Hurt by his criticism, Lisa resolves to find a single passion to which she can devote herself; astronomy. She convinces Homer to buy her a telescope, but discovers that light pollution from the city is blocking her view of the sky. After a discussion with Professor Frink, Lisa starts a petition to reduce the city's light pollution. After gaining enough signatures, Mayor Quimby agrees to turn off the streetlights, leading to a clear view of the stars, at which many people from Springfield marvel.
928	Meanwhile, Bart is looking for a way to regain his popularity after being humiliated. After seeing Nelson parading around with stolen car hood ornaments, he decides to steal one off Fat Tony's car. Milhouse and Bart are foiled on their first attempt because Quimby is pressured to switch the lights back on due to rising crime. Yet the light level is set too high which means that no one can sleep so Lisa, still wanting to see the light pollution reduced, and Bart, still wanting to steal Fat Tony's hood ornament, take a now sleep-deprived Homer to the power plant and overload the generators causing a power outage, which ends the light pollution, but before the angry citizens can attack, Lisa points out a meteor shower and the town looks on in wonderment while Bart sneaks off and steals Fat Tony's hood ornament, with Don McLean's song Vincent playing in the background .
929	By this time in the show's history, there had been an "ever-present fear that as the show ages it risks 'jumping the shark'". The Simpsons writers satirised the term's namesake (an episode of Happy Days in which Fonzie jumps over a shark on water skis) in the episode, which has a couch gag where the Simpson family jump over a tank full of sharks in a similar fashion (the gag had previously been used in the episode "How I Spent My Strummer Vacation"). Executive producer Al Jean said, "We figured that if we said it first, then they couldn't say it".
930	The full album title is It's Naz but the artwork spread the title, in block-capitals, fully over the outside of the gatefold-sleeve: when not opened only 'S NAZ is visible on the front. The back of the original album cover includes the letters "I" and "T" causing many to misinterpret the title of the album as "'Snaz" which is incorrect. That no space was left between the 'S' and 'NAZ' seems deliberate, as contemporary adverts for the album in the music press write it as IT'SNAZ. The band's official website gives the title as It's Naz.
931	The game's title character, 'Splosion Man, was created by the fictional laboratory Big Science. The character is made entirely of explosive material. The aim of the game is to go through a series of levels consisting of puzzles, traps, and enemies to escape the facility. A splode is effectively a jump, and can also be used to kill enemies, demolish walls, detonate explosive barrels or trigger other effects. The character can explode up to three times in quick succession at which point he will need to take a breather to replenish his supply.
932	Pre-production for 'Splosion Man began in early 2008, coinciding with winding down of development of The Maw, another Twisted Pixel Games title. The pre-production began in order to keep the team working on a title once The Maw was completed. Production began in December 2008, and development began in January 2009. In April 1, Twisted Pixel released a press announcement that a new game called 'Splosion Man would be released onto the Xbox Live Arcade. The next day, Twisted Pixel confirmed that the game wasn't an April Fool's Day hoax and that it would be released later in the year. It was featured at the 2009 PAX convention at Twisted Pixel's booth. 'Splosion Man was released for Xbox Live Arcade on July 22. It was the first of five titles to be released as part of Microsoft's Summer of Arcade for the Xbox 360. The developers specifically timed the development cycle so in hopes that it would be one of the titles included.
933	The premise for 'Splosion Man spawned from a random idea proposed by Sean Riley, one of the developers involved in the game. His idea was to develop a game about "a guy who splodes in a world only made of glass". The team joked about the concept until it eventually progressed into a full-fledged video game. 'Splosion Man was made a downloadable title due its simplicity in comparison to creating a retail game. The developers stated that practically any platform game may have had some influence on 'Splosion Man, though they credited Earthworm Jim for his sense of humor and Sonic the Hedgehog when comparing a sense of speed. The concept art was drawn by retired concept artist Jerome Crackershack, which was picked up by Dave Leung. Leung later became the art lead and, in the words of 'Splosion Man director James Bear, "ran with [it] and brought [it] to life". Bear explained that the game's humor was not a big part of the pre-development process, and that they "just wanted to make an awesome game". The "Way of the Coward" mode, which allowed players to skip a stage by dying enough times in a row, was added so players could experience the whole game. Using this mode also garbs the protagonist with a pink tutu.
934	Reviewers generally praised the game's humor, simplicity, and inexpensive price. Brett Todd of GameSpot called 'Splosion Man "one of the most original platformers to come down the road in a while", adding the price was "very reasonable". IGN reviewer Daemon Hatfield also lauded the game's humor, gameplay and personality, adding "not a moment goes by without seeing something new and exciting". The level design, overall gameplay length and personality were high points for Eduardo Reboucas of Game Revolution, who continued with stating that the game was "easy to play, hard to master". Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead enjoyed the game overall, but occasional repetitive level design and some minor control issues. GamesRadar+'s Nathan Meunier enjoyed the game overall, also citing the comical musical score, but shared the feeling that the level design becomes repetitive.
935	411Mania gave it a favorable review and said: "For 800 Microsoft Points, this game offers a lot of fun and enjoyment, both by yourself and with friends. Whether it is trying to beat levels, find hidden cakes or beat the par time, there is a lot to do in this game. For such a simplistic game on the surface, there is a lot to be had here, and this is one of the hidden gems in the Summer of Arcade games. Definitely try this game, but this game is really worth the price of admission". The A.V. Club's Samantha Nelson gave it a B+ and wrote: "Unlike many platformers that are packed with button-pressing combos to master, 'Splosion Man revels in simplicity. As the game manual expressly states, every button on your controller makes you do the same thing: 'splode'". In contrast, Teletext GameCentral's Roger Hargreaves gave it seven out of ten, saying that "like any good firework[s] display this fun platformer retains its charm even after the novelty runs out".
936	'Splosion Man was a commercial success, along with the four other Summer of Arcade titles. A Microsoft Australia representative stated that all five of these titles would have made the top 10 best-selling games in Australia in their first week of release. It launched as the second best-selling game in the week of July 20, 2009, with over 70,000 players. It ranked third in the following week. It was the fifth best-selling Xbox Live Arcade title during the week of August 10, 2009. It later appeared at number eight during the week of August 24. The game placed thirteenth overall 2009 sales. As of January 2011, 'Splosion Man had sold over 390,000 copies. As of year-end 2011 it had moved over 487,000 copies.
937	In January 2011, Capcom released an iOS game entitled MaXplosion, which featured several similarities to 'Splosion Man, including the same game mechanics. Twisted Pixel programmer Mike Henry said he believed the game to be "a complete theft". Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford also pointed out that Twisted Pixel Games had once pitched 'Splosion Man to Capcom, but the game was rejected. Wilford later explained that the pitch to Capcom was presented to the US branch of the company, and that the UK division handles all mobile game development. He stated that it was unlikely that Capcom US passed on the game pitch to Capcom UK. Twisted Pixel did not plan to take legal action against Capcom. Capcom responded to the allegations saying that the game was developed independently by Capcom Mobile, a different division from the one that had discussions with Twisted Pixel, and the game's similarities to 'Splosion Man was a coincidence. Twisted Pixel included a hidden jab towards Capcom in the game's sequel, Ms. Splosion Man. Upon finding a secret area the character Star from Comic Jumper: The Adventures of Captain Smiley notices similarities to other games, calling it "a ripoff". The character then states "Who made this game? Capcom?"
938	Terry Hall of Fun Boy Three owned a copy of Bananarama's previous single "Aie a Mwana", and after seeing an article about the trio in The Face, he decided he wanted them to sing background vocals on the song, solely based on the fact that he liked their look. "It Ain't What You Do...." became a big hit in the UK, climbing to number four in the UK Singles Chart, and achieving a Silver certification from the British Phonographic Industry. The success of the single also prompted Bananarama to return the favour and have Fun Boy Three sing on their next single, "Really Saying Something".
939	The first side of the album is the dialogue sculpture for four voices reducing to one.  There are many voices, male and female, as many as four at once, none of whom are identified, but one is Michael Nyman.  The voices comment on architecture, social class, welfare, Jimmy Carter, and the nature of art, among other things, often as arrogant or loud and powerful characters.  There are complaints about 'The Masterwork,' particularly by a workaday architect who does not consider himself "slashed" with multiple disciplines.  There is also brief mention of a "mirrored fish-knife." This portion of the album is a multitracked, overlaid studio production.  
940	The second season ran from September 2007 to May 2008 and consisted of 15 episodes, during which it aired on Wednesdays at 8:30 p.m. following a new comedy Back to You. Late in 2007, production was halted because of the 2007–2008 writers' strike; only 19 episodes were produced. The series went on hiatus beginning November 28, but returned with a new episode on a special night in March 2008 at 9:30 p.m. Then in April, ’Til Death moved again to Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. leading into Back to You. In May, the series was given an 18-episode order for its third season, while comedy companion Back to You was canceled.
941	The third season consisted of 22 episodes (four of which were produced during the second season) and initially ran from September to October 2008. During this brief run of seven episodes, ’Til Death aired Wednesdays at 9/8c alongside a new comedy Do Not Disturb. The ratings for both shows were low, and as a result, the network pulled the sitcom from its November schedule.  Despite not airing all of season three and low ratings, ’Til Death was renewed for a fourth season in January 2009. Fox confirmed at its upfront presentation in May that the new season would air on Friday nights in the fall. The surprise renewal was attributed to a significant licensing discount offered to Fox by the production company of ’Til Death (Sony Pictures Television), because it needed one more season to make the program viable for syndication.
942	The fourth and final season premiered in October 2009 at a new time, Fridays at 8:30/7:30c, following a new sitcom, Brothers, starring former NFL player Michael Strahan. This season is notable in that a large number of episodes produced for the third season, but previously unaired by Fox, were shown alongside new episodes produced for season four.  Four new episodes of ’Til Death aired sequentially on Christmas Day from 8/7c until 10/9c. The schedule changed again, when ’Til Death moved to Sundays at 7/6c and 7:30/6:30c on January 31, 2010, with these first two episodes airing against Super Bowl XLIV. Eventually, it was paired for three episodes with the soon-to-be-canceled comedy Sons of Tucson. The fourth season (and series) finale aired on May 23, 2010, although three unaired episodes formerly consigned for season three were burned off in June. Two months prior, Fox finally canceled production of ’Til Death after years of below-average ratings.
943	Reese (Jim Caviezel) follows Sabrina and Daniel, finding that Daniel has let a board member decide the fate of their company as their income has declined, angering Sabrina. Later, Reese notices a man planting a bomb on Sabrina's car, which he quickly disarms and throws away. Finch intercepts a call between Daniel and the man, discovering that Daniel ordered the hit on Sabrina. Reese then has Carter (Taraji P. Henson) investigate the hitman, and she partners with narcotics detective Cal Beecher (Sterling K. Brown) to get information about the man.
944	Reese then attends a book signing, where the Drakes meet and a protest ensues outside. He spots a sniper in a building targeting Daniel and saves him, but the sniper flees. Finch then finds that Sabrina contacted the sniper, and both realize that the Drakes ordered a hit on each other. Finch then calls Fusco (Kevin Chapman), who decided to ignore his calls for help in favor of meeting a woman for a date. He reluctantly agrees to show up, but his date, Rhonda (Tricia Paoluccio), surprisingly asks to go with him, which he accepts.
945	After avoiding the hitmen, Reese and Finch kidnap the Drakes and tie them up at a safe house. Failing to get any information about the hitmen they hired, Finch acts as a marriage counselor in order to resolve their issues. Reese frees them and they all go to their house, awaiting the hitmen to show up. After Reese has locked the couple securely inside their pantry, the hitmen arrive and are defeated despite shooting Fusco, who is spared by his bulletproof vest. The Drakes are subsequently arrested; however, due to their high-priced lawyers, Finch does not expect either to serve very long sentences. Beecher meets with Carter, who thanks him for his help, and both agree to go to dinner.
946	In its original American broadcast, "'Til Death" was seen by an estimated 14.43 million household viewers and gained a 2.9/7 ratings share among adults aged 18–49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 14.57 million viewers with a 3.1/8 in the 18-49 demographics. With these ratings, Person of Interest was the third most watched show on CBS for the night, beating Elementary but behind Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory, second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Grey's Anatomy, Two and a Half Men, and The Big Bang Theory.
947	"'Til Death" received positive reviews from critics. Phil Dyess-Nugent of The A.V. Club gave the episode an "A-" grade and wrote, "Speaking of reasons to love this episode, did I mention that Mark Pellegrino gets punched in the face? Pellegrino plays a man who's partnered with his wife in running a small publishing house, and in one of the most remarkable stretches for an actor since Marlon Brando signed on for Guys And Dolls, he doesn't have supernatural powers and isn't running a small publishing house against the backdrop of a savage, post-apocalyptic landscape."
948	Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the crew of the Starfleet-managed space station Deep Space Nine near the planet Bajor, as the Bajorans recover from a decades-long occupation by the imperialistic Cardassians. The station is adjacent to a wormhole connecting Bajor to the distant Gamma Quadrant; the wormhole is home to powerful alien beings worshipped by the Bajorans as the godlike "Prophets", who have made Deep Space Nine's human captain Benjamin Sisko their "Emissary". The later seasons of the series follow a war between the United Federation of Planets and the Dominion, an expansionist empire from the Gamma Quadrant, which has already absorbed Cardassia.
949	This is the second episode of the nine-episode concluding story arc of the series, which brings the Dominion War and other story elements to a close. The episode follows several major plot threads. Sisko marries his fiancée Kasidy Yates, defying a warning from the Prophets that the marriage will bring sorrow; Gul Dukat, the former leader of Cardassia and now a worshipper of the Prophets' enemies, the Pah-wraiths, begins to win over the power-hungry Bajoran spiritual leader Kai Winn; and Deep Space Nine officers Ezri Dax and Worf are being held prisoner by the enigmatic aliens known as the Breen. Ezri is a member of the Trill species, symbiotically joined to the long-lived sluglike creature Dax; the previous host of Dax was Worf's late wife Jadzia, and the complex fact of Ezri's existence leads to complicated feelings between her and Worf.
950	Kai Winn experiences has what she believes to be a vision from the Prophets—the first vision the Prophets have sent her. They say that "the Sisko has faltered," that they have chosen her to guide the "Restoration" of Bajor, and that she will be aided by a guide who has "the wisdom of the land." Dukat, disguised as a Bajoran, visits Kai Winn, posing as Anjohl Tennan, a Bajoran farmer whose life was spared during the occupation by Winn's intervention. Winn believes that this "man of the land" is the guide the Prophets sent to her guide. Dukat plays to Winn's ego and her jealousy of Sisko's status as the Emissary. Winn and "Anjohl" quickly become very close, to the disapproval of Solbor, one of Winn's aides.
951	Sisko tells Yates that the Prophets warned him against getting married, and breaks off their engagement. Although Colonel Kira, his Bajoran first officer, tells him he is doing the right thing by following the will of the Prophets, he is miserable. He chases Yates down before she leaves DS9 and tells her he wants to marry her regardless of what the Prophets say. They are married immediately in last-minute ceremony; Sisko has another vision from the Prophets during the ceremony, but tells them that he will never be happy without her.
952	Later, Madison excitedly shows her friend, Chelsea, a positive pregnancy test. Four months later, Madison secretly gets a job working with Chelsea, and confides in her that Michael has questioned the paternity of the baby, and has been abusive. Horrified, Chelsea tries to get Madison to go to the police, but Madison refuses and tries to rationalize the situation. One night, Michael and Madison are driving home from dinner, and he is upset and he pulls over. She gets out of the car, telling Michael she is calling an Uber, and he forces her back into the car saying that he won’t live without her.
953	Madison is still alive and in a flashback, it is shown how Chelsea helped her stage the accident and death to get away from Michael. The doctor at the hospital was a hired actor, and Madison took out a life insurance policy, making Chelsea the beneficiary to fund her new life. Madison relocates, gets a waitressing job, and uses a fake name, Kate Smith. Madison meets her next door neighbor Alex, a widower, and his six-year-old daughter, Rachel, and he invites her over for pie, and they hit it off. Madison and Alex get closer, as he helps her prepare for the birth of her son. Alex begins to suspect that all is not what it seems, and she tells him the truth about her life.
954	Alex takes Madison and Peace home from the hospital. Michael goes in the house as Madison takes a shower. Alex comes by, and Michael threatens to kill him if Madison tips him off. She holds it together, but Alex figures out that something is wrong, and bursts through the door and has a fist fight with Michael. Michael strangles Alex, but Madison convinces Michael not to kill him, by faking Michael out about reconciling with him, and stabs him in his side with a knife. She calls for help, and manages to get the handgun Michael had, and kills him in self defense.
955	"'Til I Can Make It on My Own" is a song co-written and first recorded by American country music artist Tammy Wynette.  It was released in January 1976 as the first single and title track from the album 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.  The song was Wynette's fifteenth number one on the country charts.  The single stayed at number one for one week and spent a total of eleven weeks on the country charts. Wynette noted on multiple occasions that the song was her personal favorite of all that she had written or recorded, and it would remain a staple of her concerts for the remainder of her career.  [1]  Wynette wrote the song with George Richey and Billy Sherrill.
956	Brian Wilson reportedly wrote "'Til I Die" while suffering from an existential crisis, having recently threatened to drive his car off the Santa Monica pier and ordered his gardener to dig a grave in his backyard. According to biographer David Leaf, these episodes were treated as jokes by Wilson's family and friends. In a November 1970 interview, Wilson discussed his daily routine of "go[ing] to bed in the early hours of the morning and sleep[ing] until the early afternoon". He added: "I'm not unhappy with life; in fact I'm quite happy living at home."  According to Wilson's (since-discredited) 1991 autobiography Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story, the song was inspired by a late night trip to the beach:
957	Lately, I'd been depressed and preoccupied with death…Looking out toward the ocean, my mind, as it did almost every hour of every day, worked to explain the inconsistencies that dominated my life; the pain, torment, and confusion and the beautiful music I was able to make. Was there an answer? Did I have no control? Had I ever? Feeling shipwrecked on an existential island, I lost myself in the balance of darkness that stretched beyond the breaking waves to the other side of the earth. The ocean was so incredibly vast, the universe was so large, and suddenly I saw myself in proportion to that, a little pebble of sand, a jellyfish floating on top of the water; traveling with the current I felt dwarfed, temporary. The next day I began writing "Til I Die", perhaps the most personal song I ever wrote for The Beach Boys…In doing so, I wanted to re-create the swell of emotions that I'd felt at the beach the previous night.
958	The song was written over the course of several weeks as Wilson tried to express the feelings he had experienced on that night he had spent alone at the beach. As he explains, "I struggled at the piano, experimenting with rhythms and chord changes, trying to emulate in sound the ocean's shifting tides and moods as well as its sheer enormity. I wanted the music to reflect the loneliness of floating a raft in the middle of the Pacific. I wanted each note to sound as if it was disappearing into the hugeness of the universe.
959	Explaining how Wilson came up with the chords, Don Was recalled, "he told me that he was sitting at a piano, creating geometric patterns with his fingers, trying not to move the fingers on the outside of the patterns, but limiting changes to internal movements. When he landed on a shape that both looked cool and sounded good, he wrote it down. So, essentially he created this masterpiece by contorting his fingers into really groovy shapes." However, Was said, "I've absolutely no idea whether this story has any basis in truth or whether he was just making it up on the spot to entertain me."
960	Wilson recorded a solo piano demo of the song on November 4, 1969. According to some sources, when he presented the song to the band, one member initially voiced criticisms. Bruce Johnston remembered Brian "playing it for the band and one member of the band didn't understand it and put it down, and Brian just decided not to show it to us for a few months. He just put it away. I mean, he was absolutely crushed. This other person just didn't like it." Various sources state that Mike Love had called the song a "downer". Engineer Stephen Desper wrote that "the guys often thought the original lyrics to ['Til I Die] were drug derived." At one stage, to address the criticism, Wilson changed the lyrics from "It kills my soul" to "It holds me up" or "It fills my soul" and "I lost my way" to "I found my way". Ultimately, the rest of the group insisted that the original lyrics be kept as the new lyrics contradicted the lyrics in the verses. A recording of the song with these alternate lyrics still exists.
961	The first dated session for the song was at Beach Boys Studio on August 15, 1970. Brian recorded five takes of the song although the song would be left only partially completed. Dennis Wilson was not present during this session due to filming dates for Two-Lane Blacktop, which resulted in a Maestro Rhythm King drum machine being used on the basic track. On August 26, the partially completed track was mixed although very little work was done on the recording until later the following year. The last dated session occurred on July 30, 1971. In Desper's recollection, Wilson played Hammond B3 organ while touring musician Daryl Dragon played vibraphone.
962	An extended mix of the original recording, created by Desper, was included on the 1998 Endless Harmony Soundtrack. It is notable for having each instrumental layer come in after the other as an introduction and features more prominent vibraphone and organ throughout. The mix was reportedly done only for the engineer's self-interest. As Desper explains, the band "went out for lunch or something like that and since the song was already mounted and a mix up, I put together what I thought was a structure that better showcased the harmonic beauty of Brian's writing. Somewhere thereafter I did play the track for Carl, but only in the interest of disclosure, not to sway him to change the structure that Brian intended."
963	The song was first released on the band's album Surf's Up on August 30, 1971. On October 11, 1971, the song was released in the United States as the flip-side of the "Long Promised Road" single, which had also been released earlier that year in May with a different B-side. The single entered the Billboard charts on October 30 in the No. 93 position. It peaked three weeks later at No. 89 on the Billboard charts, where it remained for one more week until the single dropped off the charts altogether. It was the first single by the group in 19 months to chart. However, at the time it was the lowest charting single in the group's history and it remained so for a further eighteen years.
964	Bruce Johnston praised it as the last great Brian Wilson song as well as describing it as Wilson's "heaviest song." Johnston has also stated that "the words absolutely fit his mindset". Wilson also felt this was the case when he stated that "the song summed up everything I had to say at the time." In 2015, Love named the lyrics of "'Til I Die" his favorite of any written solely by Wilson, although he admitted, "I don't like the line 'it kills my soul' but I understand what he's saying." Biographer Jon Stebbins wrote: "''Til I Die' proves that Brian could not only write beautiful music, but that he had the ability to communicate honestly and artfully with his lyrics as well. The track is decorated with a haunting vibraphone and organ bed, which frames the strong harmony vocal arrangement perfectly."
965	As a solo artist, a remake of the song was recorded – along with an accompanying video – by Brian Wilson for inclusion in the 1995 documentary I Just Wasn't Made for These Times and it would later appear on the film's soundtrack. This version, produced by Brian and Don Was, is much more sparse than the original. Brian's re-recording of the song was released as the second track on a relatively rare UK single in 1995. However, the single failed to make any impact on the charts. In 2000, over a period of two days on April 7 and 8, Brian and his band recorded a live version of the song—based on Desper's extended mix—for inclusion on Brian's 2000 live album Live at the Roxy Theatre.
966	Waylon Jennings covered this song on his 1977 album, Ol' Waylon. Willie Nelson covered it on his 1978 live album Willie and Family Live.  Jerry Jeff Walker also covered the song in 1978 on his Contrary to Ordinary album.  Bobby Bare covered the song in 1979.  Crowell recorded his own version of the song as well in 1981 on his self-titled album. The gothic band This Mortal Coil covered it on their 1991 album Blood.  Blue Rodeo covered the song in 1993. Van Morrison covered it on his 2006 Pay the Devil album. Alison Krauss recorded it in 2016 as part of a tribute album to Harris titled: The Life & Songs of Emmylou Harris.
967	StageWhispers described it as a "vocally demanding opening prologue". AllMusic described this song, along with the title song, as "crafty/schmaltzy ballads". Gramophone wrote "Karimloo’s Phantom seethes magnificently in his opening ballad ‘Til I Hear You Sing". The BBC deemed it "the musical’s most memorable song", and described Karimloo's performance as "full-blooded". Ckickey described it as " a genuinely stirring show-stopper", "prodigious", "pulsating", and a "great song". The Telegraph named it "one of the show’s finest songs". The Stage deemed the number, along with Love Never Dies, as "stand outs". Reviewing the Australian version of the musical, The Herald Sun wrote the Phantom's "opening rendition of 'Til I Hear You Sing is thrilling and no song that follows meets this level." London Theatreland wrote "I did not leave the theatre humming "Till I Hear You Sing". But will people be humming "Till I Hear You Sing" in months, years to come? Of course, they will."  Gramaphone says the Phantom "seethes magnificently in his opening ballad ". Entertainment Weekly said "Instead of Music of the Night, we get a piercing succession of key changes through Til I Hear You Sing as [Erik] longs for Christine to be restored as his muse", concluding "his musical mastery has...largely deserted him". News.com deemed it "the show's strongest number...which remains the standout performance of the night until...the title song."
968	The floor of the Chinese mental institution houses 50 male patients who are there for killing someone, committing a crime against a public official, or have a developmental disability. It is not clearly stated why the men are in the mental institution, adding to the observational approach of the documentary. The documentary film uses handheld camerawork and digital video to capture the relationship between society and individuals. Towards the end of the film, one of the patients is allowed to return to his home village. It creates a contrast to the isolation and atmostphere of the mental institution.
969	Greg Elliott from In Daily said "The Audreys' much-anticipated fourth album won't disappoint their fans" saying "The vocals, while melodic and beautiful, have a haunting, mournful edge which reflects the fact that the songs are often about unsuccessful love. The choruses are catchy and you soon find yourself singing along." In conclusion Elliot said "'Til My Tears Roll Away is quite an achievement, from the opening song, the tone of the album has a sense of loss and of love not running smoothly, but the essential underlying philosophy is 'that's how it goes' and, despite The Audreys' country-rock roots, there is less of an attitude of 'you done me wrong' and more of 'pick yourself up, carry on and keep strong'".
970	’Til Shiloh is the fourth album by Jamaican dancehall artist Buju Banton, released in 1995 on Loose Cannon Records, a short-lived subsidiary of Island Records (see 1995 in music). His international breakthrough, ’Til Shiloh marked a turn towards a more serious  path. Many of the songs on this album explore Buju's then newfound faith in the Rastafari movement, with songs such as "Til I'm Laid to Rest", and "Untold Stories". This could be seen as a transition from the rude-bwoy style to a more roots-oriented fashion, although the seventh track is based on the hardcore "Arab Attack" riddim.
971	Gwen is hired to ghostwrite the autobiography of former child star Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), whose career virtually ended following her stint on a long-running Partridge Family-Brady Bunch hybrid sitcom. Francesca owns La Fortuna, a picturesque vintage apartment complex (filmed at the historic El Cabrillo). Architect Nick Dawkan's (Dylan McDermott) boss Timo wants to buy and demolish the complex so his firm can construct a modern condominium development in its place. Francesca agrees to the sale as long as Nick is placed in charge of the project, and the two embark on a somewhat tempestuous relationship. Both are damaged emotionally; Francesca has overcome an addiction to drugs but still craves the spotlight, while Nick is dealing with the memory of a father who failed as a songwriter and became a hopeless alcoholic. Meanwhile, Gwen is shocked to discover her father Saul never loved her mother Beebee and is devastated when the two decide to divorce.  Her parents' story of how they met from her childhood turns out to be false: Saul got stood up by his date that night and Beebee thought that he was interested in her.  They only married to "avoid an argument", as Saul puts it.
972	Gwen moves into La Fortuna and finds herself surrounded by an assortment of odd but lovable neighbors who have created a family of their own. When the tenants are presented with eviction notices, they decide to fight back. Having discovered the property was designed by Sophia Monroe, one of the first female architects of note (and coincidentally Nick's mentor during the early stages of his career), and served as home to silent film star Louise Brooks, Gwen hopes she can have it declared an historical landmark with the assistance of Jon Haas, the city councilman she is dating. Nick is prepared to fight for his firm until he sees La Fortuna and learns its history and decides it might be worth preserving after all.  Though ultimately unsuccessful in preserving La Fortuna, they finally meet at the Nicotine Anonymous meeting, are then happily married, and have a daughter together.
973	In January 1996, Terence Blanchard and Miles Goodman were hired to compose the music for the film.  Director Scott Winant approved the duo, thinking the comical mastery of Goodman and the jazzy romance of Blanchard would make the perfect combination.  Blanchard was even excited about collaborating with Goodman that he rearranged his summer tour of The Heart Speaks around Goodman's ever-busy scoring schedule.  'Til There Was You would be the final film scored by Goodman; he died a year before the film's release, aged 47.  The film is dedicated to his memory.
974	Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film 1½ stars and called it "the most tiresome and affected movie in many a moon, a 114-minute demonstration of the Idiot Plot, in which everything could be solved with a few well-chosen words that are never spoken . . . and at the end of it all, we have the frustration of knowing that 114 minutes of our lives have been wasted, never to be returned . . . All comes together at the end. Landmarks are saved, hearts are mended, long-deferred love is realized, coincidences are explained, the past is healed, the future is assured, the movie is over. I liked the last part the best."
975	Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle observed, "Filmmakers should be careful about using snippets from old movies. In Til There Was You, there's a tender scene from Brief Encounter that says more about fate and the serendipity of falling in love in two minutes than this new movie does in two hours . . . 'Til There Was You hammers away at the idea that people don't find love until they're ready for it. The notion is convenient as a way of keeping Gwen and Nick apart, but it's not true. People are always meeting at inconvenient times. That's what Brief Encounter is about. First-time screenwriter Winnie Holzman may have been aware of the lameness of her central premise because she has loaded the movie with a dizzying number of subplots . . . Directing his first film after many years as a television producer, Scott Winant seems at a loss to know how to integrate these disparate elements. They come across like episodes of Seinfeld or Friends . . . Tripplehorn and McDermott don't look as if they belong together and aren't strong enough actors to overcome their physical incompatibility. So there's no sense of urgency about them getting together, as there was with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks in Sleepless in Seattle. Tripplehorn in particular makes an unlikely romantic lead; she's dull at the times she should sparkle. By contrast, Sarah Jessica Parker is the life of the movie. As Francesca . . . she appears to be doing a Madonna impersonation, grabbing the screen and holding it with the force of her personality, not to mention her cleavage."
976	Leonard Klady of Variety stated, "A tired piece of romantic cornball fare that harks back to a bygone era, the film is a badly conceived, poorly executed fairy tale guaranteed to make audiences squirm in their seats . . . Winnie Holzman's script is one of those filigree fantasies in need of an experienced, stylish filmmaker. Tyro feature director Scott Winant simply doesn't fit the bill, going for the obvious and banal . . . But ultimately, 'Til There Was You doesn't work because its leads lack charm, and the viewer remains indifferent as to whether they get together at the close."
977	Released on his Midnight Love album, it was the sole ballad in the album, which focused mainly on funk rhythms and dance material. Gaye was the sole lyricist of the song. When asked how the lyrics of the song seemed more primitive than Gaye's previous ballads, the singer said he had run out of ideas on lyrics. The song is described as a bare-bones song with "heavenly scat riffs". Gaye provides accentuated doo-wop harmonies in the background while delivering both a jazzy-inspired baritone and a gospel-inflected tenor with falsetto stuck in the middle of it. The original demo of the song (titled "Baby, Baby, Baby") showcased the frustration Gaye was going through during the recording of Midnight Love. The spoken intro by Gaye was later modified by the singer while mention of the word "shit" was also taken off of the final track as was extra lyrics added during the saxophone solo provided by Bobby Stern. The song was later covered by Chico DeBarge.
978	"Love in a Vacuum" was re-recorded for the Epic debut album, 1985's Voices Carry; however, the breakthrough song turned out to be the title track. The "Voices Carry" single peaked at number eight on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and is said to have been inspired by an argument between Mann and Hausman, who had broken off a relationship before the album's release. According to producer Mike Thorne on his Stereo Society web site, "The title track was originally written and sung by Aimee as if to a woman.... The record company was predictably unhappy with such lyrics." Rolling Stone magazine would later report that Epic Records labelmate Cyndi Lauper was interested in recording "Voices Carry" with the original lyric, but only if the band did not put it on their own release.
979	The band became an early MTV staple with the "Voices Carry" video, which depicts an oppressive boyfriend trying to convert Mann to his upper-class lifestyle; she finally lashes out at him during a concert at Carnegie Hall, though filmed at the Strand Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts, standing up from her seat in the audience and belting the lyrics, "He said, shut up! He said, shut up! Oh God, can't you keep it down...?" as she removes her cap to reveal her signature spiky, rat-tailed hair. As a result, the group won that year's MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist.
980	After the album's release Pesce left the band and was replaced by Michael Montes.  At about the same time, Mann's two-year relationship with singer-songwriter Jules Shear, whom she had been dating since the release of the Voices Carry album, came to an end. This breakup somewhat informed the band's final album, 1988's Everything's Different Now, particularly in the song "J for Jules", though Mann insisted that not every song on the LP was about the relationship. Shear collaborated with Matthew Sweet on the album's title track; it also featured "The Other End (of the Telescope)", a collaboration between Mann and Elvis Costello on which Costello provides a guest vocal.
981	Total strangers Dan Hardesty and Joan Ames meet by chance in a crowded bar in Hong Kong when she admires the "Paradise cocktail" that Dan has just concocted. He asks for another glass and pours half of his drink into it. After they drink, he breaks off the bowl of his glass and places the stem on the bar; she follows suit, and he helps her to place the stem of her glass across his. Dan leaves the bar and is promptly handcuffed by Lieutenant Steve Burke of the San Francisco police. Burke has spent a year chasing Dan, a convicted murderer who jumped off a train on his way to San Quentin to be hanged.
982	As they near Honolulu, Steve overhears Joan and Dan plan to spend the next day ashore. He takes Dan to the brig. Dan picks up a bottle to knock him out, but Steve shoots it (he had checked his gun and reloaded it). Liz slips Steve some sleeping pills and frees Dan. When he is spotted by Joan, he postpones his "business" to go on their outing. Later, on the way back, Dan stops the rented car before they reach the pier. However, when Joan collapses, Dan carries her back aboard. The ship's doctor tells Dan about Joan's prognosis. Liz tells a stunned Dan that he still has time to get away. From the doorway, Steve says, "No, he doesn't."
983	On the last night, everyone on shipboard is partying. Liz asks Burke why he has been avoiding her since Honolulu. He reveals that he got a cable about her. She tries to bribe him, to no avail. However, he is still attracted to her, saying there is less room between a cop and a countess than a cop and a con. In the bar, Dan and Joan bid each other goodbye, sharing one last Paradise cocktail and promising to meet in Mexico City at the Palace Bar on New Year's Eve.
984	Walker wrote the songs for the album quickly while on a working holiday in Greece in September 1970. The album was recorded late that same year between September and November 1970 with Walker's usual Philips studio team consisting of producer Johnny Franz, engineer Peter J. Olliff and Angela Morley and Peter Knight directing the musical arrangements. Receiving negative reviews the album was first released as an LP in December 1970. The album was removed and was not available for over twenty-five years. The album was later reassessed much more favourably and was eventually reissued in the UK on CD by BGO Records in August 1996, with new liner notes. This new edition fell out of print before a second CD re-issue followed in 2008 by the US label Water Records. The album was re-issued again on 3 June 2013 as part of a 5-CD set entitled Scott - The Collection 1967-1970.
985	At the time of release 'Til the Band Comes In received negative reviews by the majority of critics. Critical reception of the album has warmed considerably since Walker was critically reappraised in the decades following The Walker Brothers' 1978 album Nite Flights. The album is now classed as a worthy if somewhat compromised follow up to Walker's first four studio albums (not counting Walker's TV companion album; Scott: Scott Walker Sings Songs from his TV Series). Scott Plagenhoef writing for Pitchfork Media in 2008, describes Scott Walker's originals "[as] a step down from those on his previous two albums" but "worthwhile nonetheless".
986	'Til the Medicine Takes is the sixth studio album released by the Athens, GA based band Widespread Panic. The album's name refers to a line in the chorus of the 4th track Blue Indian. It was first released by Capricorn Records on July 27, 1999. It would later be re-released in 2001 by Zomba Music Group. The band once again recorded at John Keane's studio in Athens. Special guests included Dirty Dozen Brass Band, gospel singer Dottie Peoples, and vocalist Anne Richmond Boston. This would be the band's last record as part of the six-album deal with Capricorn Records.
987	In 2009, it was used in an advert for the then-upcoming game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. It raised digital download sales of the song worldwide considerably, but in Britain the song sold so many copies after the advert aired that it re-charted that week (21 November 2009) at number 73, a new peak. Shane Mosley used this song as an entrance theme with his bout with Floyd Mayweather as did Shane Carwin for his bout against Junior dos Santos. Major League Baseball pitcher Jesse Litsch used the song as his entrance music during the 2011 season. The song has also been used in the credits of the Season 8 premiere of Entourage. It was also used in September 2011 in the trailer and soundtrack for the film Real Steel, and in trailers and TV spots for the Oliver Stone-directed film Savages. During the 2013–14 NBA season, the song was used during the Brooklyn Nets' team introductions.
988	He is soon drafted into the US Army because the Korean War has started; he is sent to Europe, and rises to the rank of corporal. During his time in southern Germany, he meets men from all over the U.S. When serving as company clerk, he is sent to bring laundry to U.S. Army facilities at Dachau, a haunting experience, both for a Jewish soldier with him and for Frank, who heard all the news of World War II growing up in Limerick. Soldiers are always looking for women, trading their cigarette and coffee allotments for sex, even with refugees from WWII who are still not settled, a behavior the Army disapproves of. This leads Frank to a troubling encounter with a poor and hungry girl in a refugee camp. The people in the Army teach him a lot about American ways, so different from his upbringing in the lanes of Limerick. While in the Army in Germany, he gets two weeks leave to visit his family in Ireland, seeing his mother and youngest brothers Michael and Alphie in Limerick, and for one day, his father and paternal grandmother in Toome. He has been sending part of his Army wages to his mother, and she has gained a home with all the modern advantages of plumbing, a refrigerator and space for a garden in the Janesboro neighborhood; she does not move out of the slum house shared with her brother, where she was raised, until Frank arrives. His emotions while in Limerick are strongly mixed, between pride in his U.S. Army status, pleasure at the better life of his youngest brother who attends secondary school, and the hard memories of his own life there, the “dark clouds” in his mind. 
989	He returns to New York City, where he soon breaks up with Emma, preferring to be single in New York, going out drinking with his pals. He soon attends New York University – despite never having graduated from high school. He has the G.I. Bill to pay university tuition, and needs to work to pay for food and lodging. He takes jobs at warehouses at the docks, and then office jobs from a temporary job service, using his typing skills gained in the Army, continuing to meet many friends and interesting characters. He has some friends who are recent immigrants from Ireland as well as many friends born in the U.S. He falls in love with beautiful, middle-class American-born Alberta Small (nicknamed Mike), whom he meets at university.
990	After graduating from NYU, he teaches English and social studies at McKee Vocational and Technical High School on Staten Island. There, he deals with students who need to be brought back to the topics of the class. He continues to enjoy a drink with fellow teachers. After eight years there and some time as a substitute at a few colleges and high schools, he moves on to teaching English and creative writing at the prestigious Stuyvesant High School. At Stuyvesant, he revises his teaching style to end his reliance on textbooks and other teaching resources, to become an effective teacher of these bright students. 
991	His brothers Malachy and Michael became well-known in New York while Frank is teaching at McKee; Malachy has a bar, and a knack for attracting the rich and famous to it with his stories and easy laughter. Michael has similar talents. Frank's students ask him why he is not on television being interviewed, like his entertaining  brothers. When someone at Malachy’s bar asks him when he will join Malachy and Michael in the bar, he says, when my brothers become teachers; showing his sense  of humor to the world, even when the dark clouds are on his mind. He flies to Ireland in the summer to see his mother and his youngest brother.
992	In 1971, Frank and his wife have a daughter, Margaret Ann, called Maggie. Frank names her after his sister who died in infancy, and his two grandmothers, who are described in Angela's Ashes. He takes care of her as an infant, spending as much time as he can with her as she grows up, sharing early mornings with her, as he had shared early mornings with his father. The family lives in a house in Brooklyn, which Frank and Alberta have fixed up in modern style, with  both of them working as teachers.
993	L.S. Keep of Entertainment Weekly, described the memoir as a good successor of Angela's Ashes, concluding that "this book has the same clairvoyant eye for quirks of class, character, and fate, and also a distinct picaresque quality. It’s a quest for an America of wholesome Hollywood happiness that doesn’t exist, and it’s about the real America — rendered with comic affection — that McCourt discovers along the way. " Similarly, Margo Hammond of the St. Petersburg Times found the memoir a good read, though McCourt was unable to provide a satisfactory narrative arc to the work. Commenting for the public radio station WKMS, Jacque Day called the memoir "an exercise in humanity by a man with a rare gift for a story, and a brogue that sings on." A review of ‘Tis: A Memoir, first published in 1999, in the Tampa Bay Times noted the difference in McCourt’s clear insight into his parents’ choices compared to his understanding of his own motives, said that “McCourt's memoir actually is all the more human for this peculiar lack of reflection from an author that has seemed so uncannily perceptive in so many other areas. It reminds us once again that poverty doesn't necessarily ennoble people. We can only hope that the scars are few for those fortunate enough to survive it as successfully as Frank McCourt.”
994	Terry Golway opens his review with the statement that “You have to be Irish to hate Frank McCourt.” That reflects the candor, brutal candor, of Frank McCourt’s writing on his life in New York city, following his first memoir on his life in Ireland. Golway compares McCourt’s effect on Irish-Americans to that of Philip Roth on Jewish-Americans: “Mr. McCourt is to the Irish of the late 1990’s what Philip Roth was to Jewish Americans in the late 1960’s.” His review in The New York Observer goes on to state that “‘Tis is a remarkable and brutally candid exploration of one man’s life in New York, and Mr. McCourt is as tough on himself as he is on the racists and drunks and lost souls he meets along the way.”
995	Set often to the tune of "Digby's Farewell," this ballad details the plights of a good-fellow who spends most of his money in an ale-house, and in doing so neglects his wife and children. Historically, we can link him to the Shakespearean character Sir John Falstaff, since both can be described as companions fond of feasting, drinking, and general conviviality. The ballad's central theme is money, and it is used as a vehicle to explore the vices of drinking, commenting on the idea that a man who spends all his hard-earned coin on liquor is no true man at all. The ballad also explores issues of infidelity, since it is implied later in the ballad that the speaker forsakes the company of his wife for the company of the ale-house hostess. The tone of the ballad is moral and advisory in nature, since the speaker warns the listener about the dangers of alcohol, pleading that the listener heed his advice lest he end up like him.
996	Annabella and Soranzo are married soon after, and their ceremony includes masque dancers, one of whom reveals herself to be Hippolita. She claims to be willing to drink a toast with Soranzo, and the two raise their glasses and drink, on which note she explains that her plan was to poison his wine. Vasques comes forward and reveals that he was always loyal to his master, and in fact he poisoned Hippolita. She dies spouting insults and damning prophecies to the newlyweds. Seeing the effects of anger and revenge, Richardetto abandons his plans and sends Philotis off to a convent to save her soul.
997	When Soranzo discovers Annabella's pregnancy, the two argue until Annabella realises that Soranzo truly did love her and finds herself consumed with guilt. She is confined to her room by her husband, who plots with Vasques to avenge himself against his cheating wife and her unknown lover. On Soranzo's exit, Putana comes onto the stage and Vasques pretends to befriend her to gain the name of Annabella's baby's father. Once Putana reveals that it's Giovanni, Vasques has bandits tie Putana up and put out her eyes as punishment for the terrible acts she has willingly overseen and encouraged.
998	The play's open treatment of the subject of incest made it one of the most controversial works in English literature. The play was entirely omitted from an 1831 collection of Ford's plays; its title has often been changed to something euphemistic such as Giovanni and Annabella or 'Tis Pity or The Brother and Sister. Indeed, until well into the twentieth century, critics were usually harsh in their condemnations of the play; the subject matter offended them, as did Ford's failure to condemn his protagonist. Critic Mark Stavig wrote, "Instead of stressing the villainy, Ford portrays Giovanni as a talented, virtuous, and noble man who is overcome by a tumultuous, unavoidable passion that brings about his destruction".
999	In the city of Mantua, during the Italian Renaissance, Giovanni, the son of a propertied man, is sent to study abroad and he never meets his sister, Annabella, who is a couple of years younger than him. After ten years of separation, the now beautiful Annabella is reunited with her brother for the first time, as adolescents. The young siblings are immediately attracted and can not help falling in love with each other. After struggling with their feelings for some time Giovanni and Annabella begin a secret relationship, and she becomes pregnant. Knowing that the world will condemn them, Giovanni leaves his father's villa, and Annabella accepts the marriage proposal of her suitor, the wealthy noble Soranzo. After Soranzo discovers that he has been the object of a deception, he makes plans for a bloody vengeance.
1000	Italian film critic Marco Giusti writes that Rampling undresses as much as she can, but that it is Fabio Testi's physique that is imposing: Always naked and often framed at the height of his buttocks, it is causing the spectators some embarrassment. Giusti perfectly remembers the sight of Testi's big hairy buttocks on the screen of the cinema Verdi in Genoa.However, Teo Mora "forced" Giusti and Enrico Ghezzi to stage it at the Teatro dell'Archivolto in Genoa. Giusti acted as Soranzo, Testi's character; he has not done any theatre since.
1001	"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore" is a song by English musician David Bowie. It was originally released as a digital non-album single on 10 November 2014 and was later featured as the B-side for Bowie's next single, "Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)", which was released exactly one week later. A re-recorded version of the song appears as the second track on Bowie's 25th and final studio album, Blackstar (2016). "'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore" charted in multiple countries, including Bowie's home country of the UK, where it peaked at number 107.
1002	"'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore" was released as a single on 10 November 2014 and was later featured as one of the B-sides to "Sue (Or in a Season of Crime)", Bowie's following single. The name of the song derives from the play 'Tis Pity She's a Whore by John Ford, an English dramatist of the 17th century. Both songs were re-recorded for Bowie's 25th and final studio album, Blackstar, released on 8 January 2016. American jazz musician Donny McCaslin provided new saxophone parts for the re-recording of "'Tis a Pity She Was a Whore". Bowie played the saxophone parts himself for the original version of the song.
1003	After Thanksgiving dinner, Bart and Lisa give Marge and Homer their Christmas lists, asking for only one present: a smart TV that costs $2,400. Seeing a commercial for a Black Friday sale at the Sprawl-Mart, Marge and Homer plan a strategy to take advantage of it. Marge waits in line overnight at the store, giving Gil Gunderson some of her winter clothing so he can keep warm. Homer wakes up at 2:30 in the morning to take her place as planned, but gets his scarf caught in the front door and knocks himself unconscious.
1004	When the Sprawl-Mart opens at 6:00, Marge hurries to get a smart TV, but stops to help Gil get a present for his granddaughter. By the time she finishes, the shelves have been picked clean. In addition, Gil immediately sells the present to Reverend Lovejoy at a greatly inflated price. As Marge becomes increasingly stressed over the approach of Christmas, Homer and the children secretly book a vacation at a theme park and resort in Florida. They drug Marge's tea to put her to sleep. By the time she wakes up, the entire family is in the car and driving through Tennessee on the way to Florida.
1005	Upon reaching the resort, they find themselves booked into a cramped hotel room with an extremely low ceiling. Homer urges Bart and Lisa to act as if they are enjoying themselves for Marge's sake, but the theme park turns out to be full of bizarre, frightening rides and obscure cartoon characters. Bart and Lisa complain to the manager, Jeanie, saying that the site looks nothing like the pictures on its web page. When she ignores them, Bart vows revenge. The Simpsons finally admit to each other that they are not enjoying the trip and decide to leave quickly so they can make it home by Christmas. Bart scares Jeanie by removing the heads from the animatronic figures in the Hall of Vice Presidents and putting them in her bed.
1006	Tony Sokol of Den of Geek gave the episode 2 out of 5 points ranking, stating "''Tis the 30th Season' has a better premise than an execution, not to be confused with a crucifixion. Marge does a good deed in the spirit of the holiday and it costs her the perfect Christmas gift for the kids. It's kind of like the gift of the Maggie without even any Oh Henry bars for Homer. The Simpson family sacrifice personal happiness to the least fortunate, former salesman Gil, the unluckiest man in town, only to see it crassly discarded for a better offer. The casual cynicism sends Marge on an implosive breakdown, which is the best part of the episode, but ultimately gets caught in a chimney."
1007	Now more charitable, Homer apologizes for his mistakes, donates his old clothes to the homeless shelter, and builds a public skating rink in his backyard. Ned Flanders becomes jealous of Homer's position as the new nicest person in town, and sets out to buy gifts for everyone. Meanwhile, Lisa tells Homer about her Buddhist beliefs that people would be happier without material goods. For his next good deed, on Christmas Eve night, Homer sneaks into the citizens' houses and steals their presents. In the morning, an angry mob confront Homer and Flanders. Flanders calms them by reciting a Bible verse, while Homer gives everyone back their presents.
1008	While reviewing the DVD, Brian James of PopMatters wrote that "'Tis the Fifteenth Season" is "hardly a masterpiece, but it does feature a talking astrolabe and the phrase 'double-bacon genius-burger,' two elements that deserve a spot in Simpson Valhalla. It's a shame that such entries don't come as fast and furious as they did a decade ago, but that The Simpsons does offer a few belly laughs now and then, rather than being a complete embarrassment this late in the game is a bigger accomplishment than anyone gives it credit for. It's still just a cartoon, and still a pretty good one."
1009	The Rembrandt Research Project and other modern scholars now doubt that it is by Rembrandt at all, although it might be an unfinished Rembrandt portrait taken over by another artist.  Even more unlikely is that it is a Rembrandt self-portrait, simply on the low level of resemblance of the face to the many certain examples. It used to be dated to about 1634, on the grounds of the age of the subject, if a self-portrait, and the lack of the moustache that Rembrandt usually has for most of the 1630s.  Seen in terms of Rembrandt's style alone, about 1639-40 seems more likely.
1010	The painting belonged to the art-loving Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine ("Jan Willem", r. 1690-1716), who was married to Anna Maria Luisa de' Medici, the last of the Medici family.  Johann Wilhelm had his own collection of artists' self-portraits, like his father in law.  He gave the painting to the Gerini family,  Florentine grandees and art patrons.  It was exhibited in Florence as a Rembrandt self-portrait in 1724, and so described in the published illustrated catalogue of the Gerini collection in 1759. In the Palazzo Gerini an allegory of the arts in fresco by Giuseppe Zocchi (1711–67) shows the personification of "Painting" looking at the catalogue, held by two putti, open to the page illustrating this painting.  The highly unusual rendition in fresco of a reproductive print shows the prestige the painting had. In 1818 it entered the Uffizi's famous collection of artists' self-portraits.
1011	A troubled and irresponsible man named Nick Wrigley (Bryan Cranston) is hacked by criminals who are looking for a bank account code to Nick's boss. The criminals Bill (Jeff Geddis) and Harry (Sandy Robson) manage to find his apartment and start berating him for the Internet scam he has pulled on them. They tell him they want their money by Christmas or else they will have their enforcer Eliot (Jung-Yul Kim) beat him up. Bill and Harry leave and Nick decides to run away. Nick is leaving the building when Eliot sees him leaving and chases him. Nick manages to escape when he runs to a North Pole stage where kids meet Santa Claus. He steals the costume for Santa Claus and walks to the bus stop in disguise and goes to his brother's house.
1012	Meanwhile, the house's mischievous 14-year-old Danny Wrigley (Josh Zuckerman) welcomes his uncle because he has a better relationship with him than any other person in his family. Danny's father (Barclay Hope) however is less than thrilled to see his older brother, while his wife (Torri Higginson) welcomes Nick. Danny's parents, both doctors, are called into the hospital and reluctantly leave Nick to look after their three children. After receiving a threatening e-mail from Bill and Harry that they are currently tracking him down to get the money out of him, Nick ends up having to unleash a virus to throw them off his trail. On Christmas Eve, Santa comes to the house with a device that can freeze time, in order to put the family's presents under the tree unnoticed. An object hits the device, time goes back to normal, and Nick hits him unconscious. They decide to deliver Santa's presents. While Nick is delivering the presents, unbeknown to Danny he is stealing from the houses. When Danny finds out that Nick is stealing he feels betrayed and goes back home in Santa's sleigh.
1013	Nick is sitting at a bus stop when he sees Bill, Harry, and Eliot. They ask him where the address to his brother's house is as they don't recognize him because he is wearing a Santa costume. Nick doesn't answer them and they drive off. Nick realizes a second later they are going to his brother's house, which means that his family is in trouble. Nick, who still has Santa's device, races back to the house and get there just in time. He saves his family from the men using the device to shrink Eliot. This causes Bill, Harry, and Eliot to drive away terrified. Nick returns the device to Santa and then gives Santa his beloved laptop to fix Santa's sleigh and save Christmas.
1014	The program is set in the fictional town of Junctionville, New York around the turn of the 20th century. Santa Claus is offended by an anonymous letter printed in the town's newspaper (and signed "all of us") claiming that he doesn't exist. In response, Santa returns the entire town's letters to them unopened. Upon reading the anonymous letter printed in the newspaper, Father Mouse — a mouse assistant to the human clockmaker Joshua Trundle — immediately suspects that his brainy son Albert is its author. Albert confirms his suspicions, repeating the letter verbatim to him.
1015	The story is set on Christmas Eve in a New England town in the late 1890s. The Cosgrove family's home is in an uproar over the holidays. The patriarch, Clark Cosgrove (Paul Lynde) is frazzled by the gift demands of his loud children. His wife Nellie (Anne Meara) runs into endless friction with Clark's formidable mother (Alice Ghostley), who lives with them.  Nellie's inebriated father (Foster Brooks) and cat-loving mother (Martha Raye) arrive for the holiday, and tensions arise between the mothers-in-law.  A German uncle (Howard Morris) is also arriving, but complications ensue when a traveling salesman (George Gobel) is mistaken for the uncle. Adding to the tumult is a visit from a caroling neighbor (Anson Williams). During the night, Clark's mother-in-law's cat escapes from the house and winds up on the roof.  Clark goes to retrieve the cat and creates a ruckus, waking the house.  When the children ask if the noise came from Santa Claus, Clark initially wants to dispel the myth of Santa Claus. Instead, he appeases them by reciting A Visit from St. Nicholas.
1016	'Twas the Night Before Christmas was part of a series of American Broadcasting Company (ABC) television specials starring Paul Lynde to fulfill a contract with him after previous efforts to establish a star vehicle for him, The Paul Lynde Show and The New Temperatures Rising Show, had flopped in the ratings. Whereas previous offerings, most notably the 1976 production of The Paul Lynde Halloween Special, relied on a sketch comedy revue format, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas retained a narrative format where Lynde and his castmates remained in character for the entire show. Lynde's casting as a relatively straight, dramatic lead fulfilled a longstanding wish of his for more serious roles.
1017	The ʻulīʻulī are made of various materials and take time to assemble properly. To make the base where the rattling sound is made, a calabash gourd is hollowed out and dried until hardened. Once the gourd is dried, it is filled with aliʻi poe (Canna) seeds. The base filled with the aliʻi poe seeds, is then attached to a stick wrapped with rattan for the handle by making holes at the top of the gourd and looping the strips of rattan through the holes. Kapa material is used for the cap and attached to the top end of the handle. Assorted feathers, commonly red and yellow feathers or hackle feathers, are attached to make the cap covering the top of the instrument. Some ʻulīʻulī are made with kapa material attached to the center of the feather cap. Patterns stamped on the kapa material using ʻohe kapala, flat carved bamboo sticks. Several plants like achiote, olena, ʻukiʻuki, noni, kukui, and akala can be ground up and mixed with water to make natural ink dyes for stamping designs onto the kapa.
1018	ʻUlīʻulī are used in traditional Hawaiian hula dances. Hula dancers make rattling sounds with the ʻulīʻulī by shaking or tapping the base against the body. Hula kahiko are performed to honor the gods and entertain the royal court while preserving orally transmitted narratives and genealogies. ʻUlīʻulī are used in kahiko performances to maintain timing and to enhance sounds created simultaneously through chanting and other instruments like the ipu and puʻili. Hula ʻauana, a more modern style of hula, are performed for a larger, global audience and have broadened meanings to incorporate narratives about love and Hawaiian identity.
1019	The pahu, or hula drum, is considered to be a sacred instrument and is the primary instrument used by the kumu hula also known as the instructors. The pahu guides the dancers, dictating the pace of the dance with the rhythm of the drum. Dancers place the drum on the ground or strap it to their thigh and play it during the hula.Another drum used is the small, light-weight kilu, also known as a puniu, which is made out of a half coconut and covered with animal skin. The drum usually accompanies the pahu. In the past, pahu drums were usually made of breadfruit trees, the use of coconut wood is becoming more prevalent. The drums range from one to four feet in height. In pre-contact Hawaii the covering of the pahu drum was made with shark skin, but now the shark skin has been substituted with cow hide.
1020	The site of this protected area extends from  a latitude of 19°30'N and longitude of 45°30'E, to a latitude of 19° 10'N and longitude of 45° 15'E, with a total area of 12,658 km2 (4,887 sq mi). As well as the dissected limestone plateau underlying the linear dunes, the reserve includes part of the Tuwaiq Escarpment, wadis and gravel plains. The ergs of red sand lie parallel to each other and may be as much as 150 m (492 ft) high. They are separated by corridors with sandy or gravelly bases. The climate is hot and arid. Rainfall is very infrequent and averages about 30 mm (1.2 in) per year. Downpours on the escarpment cause the wadis to flow and water drains into the substrate where it is retained.
1021	'Uruq Bani Ma'arid has been designated an Important Plant Area because of the richness of its plant life as compared to other parts of the Empty Quarter, and the presence of many plant species endemic to the Arabian Peninsula. The limestone escarpment has little vegetation but the wadis crease the sides of the escarpment and support a variety of shrubby growth including Acacias, grasses and perennial legumes. Some scanty vegetation grows on the dunes, particularly Calligonum crinitum ssp. arabicum together with sedges and perennial grasses. In the corridors between the dunes grow dwarf Haloxylon persicum, Moringa peregrina and Commiphora myrrha. Few annual plants grow here, but after rain has fallen there is growth of new shoots on the perennial plants. 106 species of plant have been recorded in the reserve.
1022	In the 15th century, the Al Mu'ammar clan of the tribe of Banu Tamim purchased al-Uyaynah from its previous owners, the clan of Al Yazid, who are said to be a remnant of the Banu Hanifa.  Later on the town prospered considerably and attracted many settlers from the vicinity, and by the 18th century had become the leading town of the region of Nejd (central Arabia). The Islamic scholar and religious reformer, Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, was born in 'Uyaynah during this period. After extensive travels, Ibn Abd al-Wahhab returned to Uyaynah in 1740, and began his call to "purify" local Islamic practice from what he considered to be illegitimate innovations akin to idolatry.  In particular, he preached against the veneration of Muslim saints, such as Zayd ibn al-Khattab, the brother of the second Muslim Caliph Omar, whose tomb was located in Uyaynah and was venerated by locals.  Ibn Abd al-Wahhab convinced the emir of Uyaynah, Uthman ibn Mu'ammar, to implement his ideas, and the grave of Zayd was levelled.  The graveyard which contains Zayd's remains is unmarked and neglected today.
1023	On 31 July 1944 during a briefing of Home Army's general staff (Komenda Głowna Armii Krajowej) at Panska Street No. 67, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski, commander of the Home Army, received a report from General Antoni Chruściel (codename "Monter"), commander of the Warsaw district, regarding a supposed successful Soviet breach of German defenses just outside of the Praga suburb. The information was actually false, but on its basis,at 5:45 PM, Bór-Komorowski gave Chruściel an oral order to begin Operation Tempest on 1 August 1944 at 5:00 PM. The order was given upon Chruściel's request. Jan Stanisław Jankowski, the Government Delegate for Poland, was present, having previously consulted regarding the order with Tadeusz Pełczyński (codename "Grzegorz"), deputy commander, and Leopold Okulicki (codename "Kobra"), chief of staff. Janina Karasiówna was also present.
1024	Home Army’s previous plans for the uprising called for it to begin in the early morning. On 29 July 1944, on Chruściel's request, it was decided that it would start at 5:00 PM. The exact day however was to be chosen a day before fighting were to begin. The choice of the hour was dictated by heavy street traffic (commuters returning from work). The presence of traffic was to be used to make it easier for soldiers to blend in and safely get to their meeting points, as well as to transport guns and ammunition. Additionally at 5:00 PM there would be just enough sunlight left so as make gaining control of designated objects feasible.
1025	Not all units managed to keep the mobilization a secret until 5:00 PM. First shots were fired at a German patrol at 13:35 PM on Krasinski Street in Żoliborz by members of Zdzisław Sierpinski's team, who were transporting weapons for a unit of the "Reaper" Group. The Germans quickly brought a tank and a few armored vehicles with machine guns. While sweeping the area, at 5:30 PM on Suzina Street, the German patrol surprised a Polish unit from IV Battalion "Jarosław Dąbrowski" and SOB who were extracting weapons from a stash. SOB commander Włłodzimierz Kaczanowski was killed in that fight. These skirmishes resulted in German control of key intersections of Żoliborz and alerted nearby German units stationed in the Warsaw Citadel and Bielany Airport.
1026	The only adaptation from one of Dahl's own short stories was the premiere episode, "William and Mary", a tale of a wife's posthumous revenge on her husband's disembodied brain kept alive in a bowl. In "Dissolve to Black", an actress (Kathleen Widdoes) cast as a murder victim at a television studio goes through a rehearsal, but the drama merges with reality as she finds herself trapped on the show's near-deserted set. Other dramas offered startling imagery: a snake slithering up a carpeted staircase inside a suburban home, a headless woman strapped to an electric chair with a light bulb in place of her head ("Side Show"), and half of a man's face erased ("Soft Focus").
1027	The channel was originally launched only on AB Sat, in 2000 running from 17:00 to midnight on the German music channel Onyx (owned by AB Sat) which replaced channel 11 on the AB Sat collection, France Courses (now Équidia). The channel was the offshoot of Nostalgie la télé and Musique classique in the musical channels of AB Sat. The programming was different to any previously seen in France. The channel was shown via the Hot Bird satellite and aimed to partner with some of France's biggest clubs. However, success never arrived.
1028	The song is more up-tempo than the previous winners had been, as well as being somewhat less serious. It is sung from the perspective of a young woman being asked by her lover if she is "true" and "faithful", to which she answers "A little bit". This unusual admission is then justified by the comment that "everyone is in love at least once", hence nobody can be said to be entirely faithful to anyone. Befitting the lyrics, the music has a lilt to it which had been missing from the previous winners. Scholten also recorded the song in German (as "Sei ehrlich"), French ("Un p'tit peu"), Italian ("Un poco") and Swedish ("Om våren"). She sang an English version for British television as "The Moment".
1029	The play takes place over the course of a single evening in the living room/kitchen of an isolated house shared by Jessie and her elderly mother Thelma. This evening, Jessie has carefully organized the house and made other detailed preparations for the future while explaining the changes to Thelma, who does not immediately notice anything unusual. Finally Jessie asks where her late father's pistol is stored; Thelma tells her. Only after Jessie retrieves the pistol does Thelma question Jessie's strange behavior. Jessie explains that she intends to commit suicide at the end of the evening.
1030	Thelma, horrified, at first assumes Jessie is unhappy with their life together. Jessie calmly assures her that she is simply tired of living and has been for some time. Thelma speculates that Jessie's unhappy marriage, her divorce, her criminal son, the loss of her father, her epilepsy, or the pity and distaste other people feel toward her illness, are at the root of her depression; Jessie likewise dismisses these reasons, stating that her motives are purely her own and have nothing to do with other people, including Thelma. Gradually the two reveal long-hidden truths to one another: Thelma admits that Jessie's seizures began in early childhood, but went untreated for decades with Jessie herself unaware of her symptoms, while Jessie confesses the true causes of her failed marriage. Throughout it all, Thelma occasionally bursts into hysterics in which she attempts to reason with Jessie. Jessie deflects her mother's reasoning by continuing to calmly explain the mundane responsibilities Thelma must assume once Jessie is dead, including what to do in the immediate aftermath of Jessie's suicide. Thelma rejects all of it, believing that Jessie will give up her plans if Thelma refuses to cooperate, but Jessie says she will kill herself regardless.
1031	Jessie Cates: A divorced woman who lives with her widowed mother. She is an epileptic who has experienced seizures most of her life. Nothing in life has worked out for this woman, including raising a son who turned out to be a disappointing loser. She has suffered with severe chronic depression that has never been treated. In the play, her long-standing despair has been temporarily relieved by a decision that has her uncharacteristically peaceful and talkative. The usual grayness and unsteady physical energy of this woman have given way to a new purpose that is expressed in productivity and detached humor.
1032	Thelma "Mama" Cates: A widow, she is starting to feel her age and has easily allowed her depressed daughter to come and take care of all the details of her life. She sees life as she wants it to be, rather than how it is. She speaks quickly and enjoys talking. She is a simple country woman who never wanted much and could find a way to be happy with whatever she had, even if it meant lying to herself and others. She has no need for intimacy in relationships, but is energized by social situations.
1033	Norman wrote the play in 1981, it was developed at the Circle Repertory Company, and it premiered at the American Repertory Theater with Robert Brustein in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This production transferred to Broadway at the John Golden Theatre with the same cast and was directed by Tom Moore. It opened on March 31, 1983, and closed on February 26, 1984, after 380 performances. It received 4 Tony Award nominations: Best Play, Best Actress in a Play (both Bates and Pitoniak) and Best Director (Tom Moore). The Broadway cast transferred to Off-Broadway at the Westside Theatre in 1984 for 54 performances.
1034	Sissy Spacek attended the Broadway production and liked the play so much she began work on a film version. Anne Bancroft was cast as Mama. Marsha Norman adapted her own play for the film's screenplay. Tom Moore, who directed the play on Broadway, also directed the film. The film added more characters, whereas the play featured only two performers. The film received mixed reviews and was not nominated for any Academy Awards, although Bancroft was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Spacek was nominated for the Academy Award that year for Crimes of the Heart, another film adaptation of a play, released the same year.
1035	Today, the beverage is most associated with Tongan cuisine, although similar versions of 'otai were made and enjoyed in other archipelagoes, including Uvea, Samoa, Futuna, Tokelau, Hawai'i, and Fiji. The original Samoan version as recorded by European colonists in the 1890s was made by mixing grated ambarella fruit (called vi in Samoan language and Tongan, wi in Hawaiian language) and young coconut meat with coconut milk and coconut water. The mixture was poured into large, empty coconut shells corked with coconut husk and allowed to chill in cold pools of water (or behind waterfalls) before serving.
1036	The modern Tongan recipe most well-known today is usually a blend of water, shredded coconut meat, and any variety of grated tropical fruits, most commonly watermelon, mango and pineapple, with watermelon being the most used in the Tongan Islands.  Sugar is usually added to taste. Tongan historians have noted this version is a very modern take on the traditional Polynesian ʻotai, especially since milk, refined sugar, watermelons, mangos, and pineapples are all introduced, foreign ingredients that were not native to Tonga. The original Tongan recipe was said to be identical to the Samoan recipe, except the preferred native fruit was not ambarella (vi), but the Tongan mountain apple, called fekika. In Samoa, this distinction of "native" and "introduced" recipes is differentiated as "ʻotai" only refers to the drink prepared with vi fruit, while the ʻotai made with European-introduced fruits are respectively called vai meleni (watermelon drink), vai mago (mango drink), or vai fala (pineapple drink).
1037	Dancers of the ʻōteʻa make gestures reenacting daily occupations of life. For the men the gestural themes can be chosen from warfare or sailing, and then they may use spears or paddles. For women the gestural themes are typically closer to home or from nature: hand gestures suggesting combing their hair, or the flight of a butterfly. More elaborate themes have been adopted; for example one where the dancers end up in a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper ʻōteʻa the story of the theme should pervade the whole dance.
1038	The city's official name is a contraction of the (archaic) Dutch des Hertogen bosch—"the forest of the duke". The duke in question was Henry I of Brabant, whose family had owned a large estate at nearby Orthen for at least four centuries. He founded a new town located on some forested dunes in the middle of a marsh. At age 26, he granted 's-Hertogenbosch city rights and the corresponding trade privileges in 1185. This is, however, the traditional date given by later chroniclers; the first mention in contemporaneous sources is 1196. The original charter has been lost. His reason for founding the city was to protect his own interests against encroachment from Gelre and Holland; from its first days, he conceived of the city as a fortress. It was destroyed in 1203 in a joint expedition of Gelre and Holland, but was soon rebuilt. Some remnants of the original city walls remain.
1039	In the years of Truce, before the renewed fighting after 1618, the fortifications were greatly expanded. The surrounding marshes made a siege of the conventional type impossible, and the fortress, deemed impregnable, was nicknamed the Marsh Dragon. The town was nevertheless finally conquered by Frederik Hendrik of Orange in 1629 in a typically Dutch stratagem: he diverted the rivers Dommel and Aa, created a polder by constructing a forty-kilometre dyke and then pumped out the water by mills. After a siege of three months, the city had to surrender—an enormous blow to Habsburg geo-political strategy during the Thirty Years' War. This surrender cut the town off from the rest of the duchy and the area was treated by the Republic as an occupation zone without political liberties (see also Generality Lands).
1040	After the war, 's-Hertogenbosch was modernized, like many other cities in the Netherlands. It was probably only geography that shielded the old town from rigorous reconstruction in those early years. Just in time, the pendulum swung over to protecting the history of the city. In 1956, the council wanted to demolish the Moriaan, the oldest brick building in the Netherlands, to give traffic better access to the market square. The permit was refused by the government and instead the building was restored, starting in 1963. Later, city councils became much more aware of the value of historic buildings and from about the turn of the millennium, the historic fortifications are also given much attention by the authorities.
1041	's-Hertogenbosch has a strong carnival tradition. In its current form the story and symbolism dates from 1881 to 1883. In these years some citizens created the legend of "Oeteldonk", whereby the city was renamed to Oeteldonk for the three day carnival. "Donk" is a reference to a dry place in the marsh. The frog is widely used as a symbol during the 's-Hertogenbosch Carnival. It's also a symbol of the Oeteldonk marsh. It was also a remark aimed at Bishop Godschalk from Den Dungen, where 'Van den Oetelaar' was a common family name. He had wanted to forbid the traditional festivities of Shrove Tuesday that often led to excesses.
1042	The citizens of 's-Hertogenbosch wear traditional outfits throughout these days. A so-called boerenkiel is worn and every year patches are designed according to that years theme which can then be stitched onto the outfit. The boerenkiel is often combined with a traditional farmers bandana and a long scarf in the colors of Oeteldonk. The tradition of the Boerenkiel and / or Bandana is very different from the carnival traditions in the rest of the Netherlands. Other aspects like the parade, the temporary name and the temporary flag (for Oeteldonk red, white and yellow) are very similar.
1043	's-Hertogenbosch was founded as a fortified city and that heritage can still be seen today. After World War II, plans were made to modernise the old city, by filling in the canals, removing or modifying some ramparts and redeveloping historic neighbourhoods. Before these plans could come to effect, however, the central government declared the city a protected townscape. Most historic elements have been preserved. In contrast to cities like Rotterdam, 's-Hertogenbosch also survived the Second World War relatively unscathed. Much of its historic heritage remains intact, and today there are always renovations going on in the city to preserve the many old buildings, fortifications, churches and statues for later generations.
1044	The city center has a cozy atmosphere because of the almost continuous ramparts that still surround it. It has been molded by the multiple rivers that convene on 's-Hertogenbosch, giving the center its strange street plan so different from the usual grid plan, where streets meet at right angles. The center is dominated by Saint John's Cathedral (Sint Jans kathedraal in Dutch), which dates from c. 1220 and is best known for its Brabantine Gothic design and the many sculptures of craftsmen that are sitting on almost every arc and rim along the outside of the cathedral. In 2010 an extensive restoration was completed, undoing the damage of many years of wear-and-tear and acid rain.
1045	On the central square is the oldest remaining brick house of the Netherlands, 'de Moriaan', which was built at the beginning of the 13th century. In the 1960s, de Moriaan was renovated to its former glory based on a famous 16th-century Dutch painting called 'De Lakenmarkt van 's-Hertogenbosch' ('The fabric market of 's-Hertogenbosch'). The town hall is an originally 14th-century Gothic building. After the town was conquered by the Dutch Republic in 1629, it got a new facade in the style of the Dutch Baroque architecture. It showcased the authority of the new masters, just like the new town hall in Maastricht would.
1046	Hidden below the old city is a canal network called the Binnendieze, which once spanned 22 km (14 mi). It started out as a regular river, the Dommel, running through the city in medieval times. Due to lack of space in the city, people started building their houses and roads over the river. Later, the Binnendieze functioned as a sewer and fell into disrepair. In recent decades, the remaining sixth part of the old waterway system has been renovated, and it is possible to take several guided subterranean boat trips through it.
1047	In the north east of the old city, the hexagonal gunpowder magazine, called Kruithuis is located close to the citadel. It is one of only a handful that still exist in the Netherlands, and was built when the city was still part of the Spanish Netherlands. It is planned to become the museum of fortress 's-Hertogenbosch. One of the bastions of the fortress now houses the mini museum Bastionder. It has been dug out in a bastion of the south side. On the inside it shows a unique wrought iron cannon, and an older bastion that was walled in by the current one.
1048	On the south side of the city, the city center and walls still border the Bossche Broek, an old polder that could never be made dry. In 1995 the dyke of the Dommel broke and an enormous amount of water entered the polder. It also flooded and blocked the main Dutch highway A2. In order to prevent this in the future, the area was rearranged to store excess water in case of emergencies. In 2006 the area had been furnished with higher dikes and locks that allowed a controlled flooding of the polder and some adjacent areas in case of emergency.
1049	The city has one professional football club, FC Den Bosch It is the 1967 successor of the professional branches of BVV (Bossche Voetbal Vereniging) and Wilhelmina. Both of them still exist as amateur football clubs. As a successor of BVV FC Den Bosch can claim the national championship of 1948. This championship led to the construction of stadium De Vliert, which at one time had a capacity of 30,000. Due to the less successful years that followed, the capacity is now only 8,500 visitors. FC Den Bosch was the first club of Dutch international player Ruud van Nistelrooy.
1050	's-Hertogenbosch is more successful in field hockey. It is home to top club HC Den Bosch. The women's team in particular kind of dominates the Dutch field hockey competition. The professional basketball club New Heroes Den Bosch is also very successful. The city's rugby club is called The Dukes and dates from 1974. It is located at a very scenic location at the foot of the city walls. Because of the limited space, the club plays on artificial turf and part of the accommodation is subterranean. The Dukes has the most junior members. It became the national rugby champion in 2008.
1051	As regards events the city is host to the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships, a combined ATP Tour and WTA Tour grass court tennis event played two weeks before the Wimbledon Championships. The World Archery Championships and World Para Archery Championship were held here in June 2019. During these combined World Championships two separate venues were used: the Parade and the rugby fields of The Dukes. All finals took place in the arena at the Parade. The Parade is a historic square surrounded by high trees, situated at the foot of the nearly seven-hundred-year-old Saint John's Cathedral in the attractive center of 's-Hertogenbosch.
1052	The Zuid-Willemsvaart runs from the Meuse just north of the city towards Maastricht via Helmond and Weert. In 's-Hertogenbosch it runs through the city proper, south east from where a bastion has been cut off from the citadel. Because of this route it was impossible to widen it further than for ships of CEMT class II. Therefore the Máxima Canal of 8 km was dug just east of the city, creating a shortcut from the canal to the Meuse suitable for ships of CEMT class IV. On the remaining part of the Zuid-Willemsvaart west of the city is the industrial harbor of 's-Hertogenbosch. A marina is located in the center.
1053	's-Hertogenbosch is situated on the busy A2 motorway, the most important north-south connection of the Netherlands. This connection was established with the opening of the Dieze Bridge in 1942. From 1961 the Utrecht-'s-Hertogenbosch section was 2 times 2 lanes. In 1970 the A2 was rerouted to the east of the city. In 1989 it finally became a controlled-access highway. In 1996 the section between 's-Hertogenbosch and Eindhoven became a controlled-access highway. The situation in Maastricht was only solved in 2016, when the Koning Willem-Alexandertunnel was opened. On the east-west axis 's-Hertogenbosch is on the A59 motorway. The A65 motorway between 's-Hertogenbosch and Tilburg is a regional highway, but is not completely access-controlled.
1054	's-Hertogenbosch railway station is on the Utrecht–Boxtel part of the railway stretch between Amsterdam and the Dutch industrial/tech center near Eindhoven. As a consequence north-south trains depart every ten minutes. On the Tilburg–Nijmegen railway trains run on a more modest schedule. 's-Hertogenbosch railway station is also a major station for Arriva buslines that serve the city and most of its suburbs. Other stations within the limits of the municipality are 's-Hertogenbosch Oost railway station and Rosmalen railway station. Vught railway station is actually closer to the city center than that in Rosmalen.
1055	's-Hertogenbosch has attempted to adapt to the growing popularity of the bicycle in Dutch cities. A reasonable amount of bike paths has so far been constructed in the town. In 2011, the city was chosen as Fietsstad 2011—the top bike city of the Netherlands for 2011. The details of the report were less jubilant and showed that it was really a prize meant to stimulate 's-Hertogenbosch to take further action; Hugo van der Steenhoven of the Fietsersbond: "In the past years Den Bosch has spent much energy, ambition, creativity and money to give cycling an enormous boost. This is a big achievement for a city where bicycle use is lower than in the rest of the Netherlands" (cyclist union).
1056	's-Hertogenbosch has multiple vocational universities called 'Hogeschool' in Dutch. The HAS Hogeschool of about 3,500 students is focused on agricultural and food technology. Avans Hogeschool is located in 's-Hertogenbosch and two nearby cities. The AKV St. Joost is an art academy that is now part of Avans and dates back to 1812. Fontys Hogeschool also offers some education in the city. The Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS), located at the Mariënburg Campus in the center of 's-Hertogenbosch, and provides a number of data science programs at graduate (MSc) and post-graduate level (PhD). It is a department of the Eindhoven University of Technology and Tilburg University.
1057	's-Hertogenbosch station opened on 1 November 1868 as the northern terminus of the southern part of the Utrecht–Boxtel railway (Staatslijn H), with service south to Boxtel. Only in 1870 were the two parts of Line H joined together, allowing for direct service to Utrecht Centraal. As the town was a fortress at the time, the station was designed with attack in mind; its wood truss construction allowed it to be dismantled or damaged with minimal waste. 's-Hertogenbosch station was further expanded upon the opening of the Tilburg–Nijmegen railway, making it an important railway junction.
1058	A more modern, post-war building designed by Sybold van Ravesteyn was erected in 1951. The remaining parts of the second building were incorporated, while the third station's canopy remains to this day. 's-Hertogenbosch was again rebuilt in 1998, with an extension of the roof to the other island platform. Much of the renovation consisted of an aerial walkway, the Stationspasserelle, connecting the roadways on either side of the tracks, and the removal of a special ramp to the platforms. Criticism of the fourth station was levied due to wind sensitivity; Nederlandse Spoorwegen retaliated by declaring: "You are indeed at the train station to go, not to hang out."
1059	In 1791, a great fire broke out and charred the entire building. Instead of demolishing it and constructing a new arsenal in its place, the decision was made to plaster the building to imitate sandstone, creating the distinctive white look it has today. After the French invasion in 1795, the Dutch Admiralty was disbanded and a national navy was formed; the function of the arsenal changed as well. It no longer stored cannons, ropes and gunpowder but clothing and food. After the French left, the building was given to the newly formed Dutch navy and stayed in the navy’s control until 1973.
1060	Historically, 't Asbroek formed part of the adjacent Amerlo castle domain. The lower part of the domain was mostly wetland (broek in older Dutch) filled with ash (asch in older Dutch) trees, hence giving the forest its name. During the Second World War the domain was struck twice by V-bombs directed at the port of Antwerp. After 1945 a large portion of the domain was planted with dense rows of Aspen trees for future logging. After the handover to Natuurpunt, commercial logging was halted. However, because of trunk rot a large number of Aspen trees had to be cut down in 2019 in order to protect adjacent residential housing. In the long term, Natuurpunt hopes to restore the area back to its original state with only indigenous vegetation.
1061	Along with Vordenstein park and the Peerdsbos forest, 't Asbroek forms part of a chain of forested domains at the northeastern border of the city of Antwerp, which houses a Roe deer population. The domain can be classified as a carr with iron-rich seeps that can cause the puddles and streams to color orange or red. The craters created by the V-bombs have become puddles which are inhabited by the palmate newt salamander. The forest also houses a diverse bird population, including the eurasian nuthatch, tawny owl and various woodpecker species.
1062	't Haantje was founded in the latter half of the 19th century, when peat labourers spontaneously settled there. On 1 December 1965, the village barely escaped a disaster. A French company working for the N.A.M. was drilling for gas, and started to lose control of the enormous gas pressure. During the afternoon, this resulted in a huge gas eruption. The ground around the hole caved in - swallowing all of the drilling equipment. The gas eruption was eventually stopped by a cement injection from a new drilling hole. A small lake lake surrounded by a forest forms a permanent reminder of this event.
1063	't Harde is a relatively young village. The village is called 't Harde because it was built on a patch of solid ground in the middle of a swamp. In Dutch, hard has the same meaning as "hard" in English; as in: hard surface. After a military base was established near the village, the village expanded. 't Harde even got a swimming pool in 1953, which was very modern for that time. The pool was also used as a water supply to extinguish any fires that occurred in the vicinity of the village.
1064	It started with the crossover band The Prophets of Finance which stopped around 1993–1994. In 1997, 't Hof van Commerce was founded, and in 1998, they release their first album En in Izzegem, referring to the little city Izegem where the band was founded. About 8000 albums were sold. That was quite a high number for a debut because the entire CD was sung in West Flemish, only understood by about one million people. The next year, they already had a second CD with the title Herman. That album was sold 5000 times.
1065	While the Wilson loop is an order operator, the 't Hooft operator is an example of a disorder operator because it creates a singularity or a discontinuity in the fundamental fields such as the electromagnetic potential A.  For example, in an SU(N) Yang Mills gauge theory a 't Hooft operator creates a Dirac magnetic monopole with respect to the center of SU(N).  If a condensate is present which transforms in a representation of SU(N) which is invariant under the action of the center, such as the adjoint representation, then the magnetic monopole will be confined by a vortex lying along a Dirac string from the monopole to either an antimonopole or to infinity.  This vortex is similar to a Nielsen-Olesen vortex, but it carries a charge under the center of SU(N), and so N such vortices may annihilate.
1066	In his 1978 paper, 't Hooft demonstrated that Wilson loops and 't Hooft operators commute up to a phase which is an n-th root of unity.  The choice of root of unity is related to the linking number of the Wilson loop and the vortex. 't Hooft claimed that this apparently non-local commutation relation implies that any phase of a Yang-Mills gauge theory must either contain massless particles, responsible for the interactions between the 't Hooft operator and the Wilson loop, or else at least one of the two operators must be confined by an object one dimension higher.  He identified the phase in which the 't Hooft operator is confined as the Higgs phase, in which the confinement of magnetic monopoles by vortices was a well-known consequence of the Meissner effect, already observed in type II superconductors. He identified the phase in which the Wilson loop is confined as the confining phase, as a Wilson loop is the action of an electric charge.  Finally he left open the possibility of mixed phases, in which both are confined.  Although such mixed phases had not been seen in quantum field theory at the time, they are now known to occur for example in the Argyres-Douglas conformal field theory.  Therefore, he argued that gauge theories are necessarily in one of these four possible phases.
1067	't Hooft found a simple formula for the scalings of the Wilson and 't Hooft operators in the various phases.  When a given operator is confined, a finite tension surface is created whose boundary is the operator.  The action of the configuration, in the limit in which the configuration is large, therefore scales with the volume of this surface.  In the confining phase the Wilson loops are confined by a 2-dimensional surface, and so the action of a Wilson loop scales as the area of this surface.  In the Higgs phase the (d-3)-dimensional 't Hooft operator is confined, and so the action scales as the area of the (d-2)-dimensional confining surface.  For example, in the confining phase in 4 space-time dimensions the action of the 't Hooft operator scales as the distance squared.  In the mixed phase both operators are confined, and so both obey this scaling.
1068	On the other hand, he claimed that if a given operator is Higgsed, then the corresponding gluons are massive and so the action falls off exponentially away from the operator.  Therefore, the action will be proportional to volume of the surface on which the operator is evaluated itself.  For example, in the Higgs phase the gauge field is Higgsed and so the Wilson loop action is proportional to the length of the loop, which scales linearly with distance.  In the confining phase the 't Hooft operator is Higgsed, and so the corresponding action fails as the area of the corresponding (d-3)-dimensional surface, for example linearly in 4 spacetime dimensions.  In particular 't Hooft concluded that in 4 dimensions if both the actions of the Wilson and 't Hooft loops scale linearly then both are Higgsed and so there must be massless particles in the spectrum.
1069	 't Kapoentje was created when the newspapers De Gids and De Standaard contested one another over copyright issues. The titles of the magazines Ons Volk Ontwaakt and Ons Volkske which were published by the newspaper De Nieuwe Standaard (n.v. De Gids) were claimed back by De Standaard in 1947. As a result, Ons Volk Ontwaakt was discontinued and changed to a new name, Overal, while the series which appeared in Ons Volkske were republished in  't Kapoentje. From October 11, 1951 on 't Kapoentje became a free supplement of Het Volk.
1070	 't Kapoentje published many comics by Marc Sleen, Willy Vandersteen, Bob De Moor, Eugeen Hermans (aka "Pink"), Rik Clément, Buth, Jef Nys, Karel Boumans, Marcel Steurbaut and the Dutch series Dokie Durf by Piet van Elk. In later years Hurey, Karel Boumans, Marcel Steurbaut, Arle (pseudonym of Berck and Leo Loedts), Frank Sels, Gilbert Declercq, Jeff Broeckx, Albert van Beek, Henk Kabos, Henk Sprenger, Piet Wijn, Ton Beek, Gerrit Stapel, Dick Vlottes, Raymond Bär van Hemmersweil, Jan van Reek, Peter de Smet also had their comics published. During its heyday Sleen's Piet Fluwijn en Bolleke and Vandersteen's De Vrolijke Bengels were the most popular comics. In 1947 Vandersteen left to join De Standaard. Bob De Moor continued De Vrolijke Bengels until 1950, when Sleen took over the series and renamed it De Lustige Kapoentjes, who quickly became the magazine's mascots.
1071	't Lam was built before 1698. It was bought in that year by Dirck Tjebbes and was described as a bone mill. An advertisement in the Leeuwarder Courant of 12 July 1775 asked for tenders to repair the corn mill at Woudsend. In January 1837, the mill was bought by M A Tromp. He modernised the mill, and it was offered for sale under the name 't Lam in 1839 for ƒ4,200.25. The mill was then a corn,  malt, mustard, pearl barley, and rye mill. The mill was again advertised for sale in 1840 for ƒ2,600. After being offered for sale in 1848 for ƒ2,525, the mill was bought from Wietse Hettema in 1849 by Carl Johan Albert Siegert for ƒ4,500. The mill passed to his son Carl J W Siegert and was advertised for sale for ƒ2,526 following his death in 1870. It was not sold, and was run by Carl Ernest Hugo Siegert until his death in 1915, passing to his son Foeke Siegert. A pair of sails broke in that year. New sails were fitted, as was a replacement windshaft. The windshaft had previously been used in Windlust, Sneek, Friesland, which had burnt down in 1914. The work was carried out by millwright Jan Piers Oly of Sneek.
1072	In 1935, ownership of 't Lam was transferred to Carl Ernest Hugo Siegert. The mill worked through World War II, but the stage was in a poor condition. It was restored in 1948. The mill remained in the Siegert family until 1959, when it was sold to Bauke Lyklema. He sold it to the Gemeente Wymbritseradiel in 1960 for ƒ4,500.  Further restorations were carried out in 1970-71, 1981 and 1992-93. The latter was carried out by millwright Hiemstra of Tzummarum, Friesland at a cost of ƒ288,300. In 1999, the gemeente bought the adjoining miller's house for ƒ235,000. It was converted into an information centre and shop. Internal works were carried out in 2012, including the installation of a new pair of millstones. The mill is now owned by the Gemeente Sûdwest Fryslân. It is listed as a Rijksmonument, № 39846.
1073	't Lam is what the Dutch describe as a "Stellingmolen". It is a smock mill on a brick base. The stage is 5.10 metres (16 ft 9 in) above ground level. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of 20.00 metres (65 ft 7 in). The sails are carried on a cast-iron windshaft, which was cast by NSBM, Feyenoord, South Holland in 1852. The windshaft also carries the brake wheel which has 53 teeth. This drives the wallower (26 teeth) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft is the great spur wheel, which has 91 cogs. The great spur wheel drives three pairs of 1.50 metres (4 ft 11 in) diameter millstones via lantern pinion stone nuts which have 26, 28 and 30 staves respectively. Two of the three pairs of millstones are Cullen stones.
1074	Her final departure to Batavia was on 19 February 1627, under the command of David Pieterszoon de Vries. It stayed at the Cape of Good Hope from 16 July to 7 August. In September it made landfall at Shark Bay, noting corrections to Dirk Hartog's chart of the location. It arrived at Batavia on 13 October. It appears to have remained mostly in the Indies from then on, but is named as one of the ships that participated in the Battle of Abrolhos on 12 September 1631 off Pernambuco (present-day Brazil).
1075	The mill was probably built in 1878, replacing an earlier mill that had been built c.1790 and had burnt down. Draining the Huitebuurster polder, it was formerly named De Huitebuurstermolen, only being renamed 't Zwaantje in 1987. In 1956, the mill was partly dismantled and a Lister diesel engine was installed to pump water. The mill was restored in 1986 by Messrs Waghenbrugghe of Sneek, Friesland. The restoration incorporated the sails, windshaft, brake wheel and Archimedes' screw from De Noordster (English: The North Star), Nieuwe Bildtdijk, which had been demolished in 1984. It was thought that De Noordster only dated from 1936, and thus it was not listed as a Rijksmonument.  This was an error, as the mill actually dated from 1818; 1936 being the date that the leading edges of the sails were fitted with Dekkerised leading edges. 't Zwaantje was capable of draining or pumping water into the polder. The mill was restored in 1987.
1076	't Zwaantje is what the Dutch describe as a Grondzeiler. It is a two-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to ground level. The mill is winded by tailpole and winch. The smock and cap are thatched. The sails are Common sails. They have a span of 16.30 metres (53 ft 6 in). The sails are carried on a cast iron windshaft, which was cast by IJzergieterij H. J. Koning of Foxham, Groningen in 1910.   It also carries the brake wheel which has 48 cogs. This drives the wallower (31 cogs) at  the top of the upright shaft. At the bottom of the upright shaft there are two crown wheels The upper crown wheel, which has 34 cogs, drives an Archimedes' screw. The lower crown wheel, which has 33 cogs is carried on the axle of an Archimedes' screw, which is used to drain the polder. The axle of the screw is 50 centimetres (1 ft 8 in) diameter and 1.25 metres (4 ft 1 in) long. The screw is 1.25 metres (4 ft 1 in) diameter. It is inclined at 30°. Each revolution of the screw lifts 506 litres (111 imp gal) of water.
1077	On a phonological level, the rule is a form of voicing assimilation: the consonant of the past-tense ending takes on the voicing of whatever sound precedes it. Thus, the endings beginning with voiceless -t- are used after voiceless consonants, while the endings beginning with voiced -d- are used after voiced consonants and vowels (which are always voiced). Similar rules appear in several other Germanic languages, such as Swedish and English. In English, the rule is not usually reflected in spelling, but is still regular in pronunciation: compare raced /ɹeɪst/ and razed /ɹeɪzd/.
1078	'the other' Jan van Kessel was a still life specialist who painted still lifes of fruits, hunting pieces and flowers.  About 30 works have been attributed to Jan van Kessel. Attribution of work to 'the other' Jan van Kessel has been difficult due to confusion with other artists with a similar name all active around the same time.  In addition to the still life painter Jan van Kessel the Elder, there was another Antwerp painter referred to as Jan van Kessel the Younger (the son of Jan van Kessel the Elder) who is believed to have painted still lifes, while in Amsterdam there was a Jan van Kessel known as a landscape painter. His work has often been confused with that of his better known namesake and contemporary, Jan van Kessel the Elder as well as that of Jan van Kessel the Younger.  'the other' Jan van Kessel and Jan van Kessel the Elder have a distinctive manner of signing.
1079	After having arrived on Tahiti in 1797, the LMS missionaries quickly intimidated the local rulers of the island and fixed themselves in a position of power. Although this enabled them to abolish such habits as infanticide, cannibalism and tribal wars, it also enabled them to introduce the idea of sin, which was unknown on Tahiti until then. The joy of dancing, so dear to the Polynesian heart, was one of the first to be axed. The famous Pōmare code of 1819 declared the ʻupaʻupa (and tattooing in the same line) to be bad and immoral habitudes, severely to be opposed. The Leewards  followed suit soon after. But dancing continued in secret.
1080	In the code of 1842 many restrictions were relaxed, but the ʻupaʻupa (the general term for dancing then) remained on the black list. In the same year the French proclaimed the protectorate. Being Catholic with some broader views on life than the Protestants, and considering that 'if you cannot beat them, join them', they proclaimed in the official bulletin of 1849 that the ʻupaʻupa was still forbidden, except on public feastdays, but then still without the indecent gestures. The act of 1853, repeated in 1876 was more restrictive. In the hope that the Tahitians would spend their time on more pious occupations than dancing and drinking, a system of licences was introduced. A license could only be obtained by a chef and only on Saturday evenings.
1081	In the beginning of the 20th century Tahitian dances were only performed on such festivities as 14 July and saw an evolution into what they have become nowadays. Around 1900 the traditional costumes came back, and although they still looked more like mother Hubbard dresses or ponchos, at least they were made of traditional materials. Around 1920 strips of raffia were added, which soon would develop into the characteristic more or grass skirt (in reality made from hibiscus fibers) of Tahiti. The bare torso (for men only) became acceptable. Prizes started to be awarded to the best dancers on a festival. But it was not until 1956 that Madeleine Mouʻa organised a dance group, called the heiva, of which Teriʻi and Takau, daughters of the last queen of Tahiti became patrons. Finally then traditional dancing had the blessing from the establishment.
1082	(((GRRRLS))) is the first full-length album from indie rock ensemble Parenthetical Girls. Originally released on January 2004 in vinyl-only format on Slender Means Society the label re-released the album on CD in expanded and remastered form on 25 April 2006. The album features a total of seven songs, each given mixing treatment from Jherek Bischoff and Jamie Stewart, and split into two parts—sides "O" and "X" respectively on the original vinyl version, and as standard play/enhanced MP3s on the CD version. It features album art by American artist Kathryn Rathke.
1083	(+)-Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is an organic compound with molecular formula C20H14O3.  It is a metabolite and derivative of benzo[a]pyrene (found in tobacco smoke) as a result of oxidation to include hydroxyl and epoxide functionalities.  (+)-Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide binds to the N2 atom of a guanine nucleobase in DNA, distorting the double helix structure by intercalation of the pyrene moiety between base pairs through π-stacking.  The carcinogenic properties of tobacco smoking are attributed in part to this compound binding and inactivating the tumor suppression ability of certain genes, leading to genetic mutations and potentially to cancer.
1084	Pyrene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of four benzene rings fused together in a planar aromatic arrangement which approximates a rhombus in shape.  Benzo[a]pyrene is a derivative in which a fifth benzene ring has been fused to the pyrene system, and is a component of tobacco smoke which is a procarcinogen partly responsible for the carcinogenic and mutagenic effects of smoking.  Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is a metabolite of benzo[a]pyrene formed by the introduction of vicinal hydroxyl and epoxide functional groups to the fifth benzene ring.  These oxidations are stereoselective, producing the pair of enantiomers with the hydroxyl groups on opposite sides of the pyrene plane and with the epoxide on the same side as its adjacent hydroxyl group.   (+)-Benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide is specifically the (7R,8S,8aR,9aS) stereoisomer.
1085	The metabolism of the tobacco smoke procarcinogen benzo[a]pyrene involves three distinct steps – the introduction of an epoxide group in the 7,8-position, its hydration to a vicinal diol and the introduction of an epoxide in the 9,10-position.  In the first step, a cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) catalysed oxidation produces several products including (+)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-epoxide.  The enzyme epoxide hydrolase, then hydrates the epoxide ring to yield the vicinal diol (−)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol, which is then oxidised by cytochrome P450 oxidase again forming the mutagen and carcinogen (+)-benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide.  This diol epoxide covalently binds to DNA by a ring-opening to alkylate the nucleobase forming a distorted structure, as shown at right, with intercalation of a pyrene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon moiety between the base pairs favouring π-stacking; these distortions have been confirmed by X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance structure studies.  Aflatoxin has a similar mechanism of action, though its binding is through the N7, rather than the N2, position of guanine.  Multiple stereochemical outcomes are possible from these transformations.  The anti stereoisomer (shown here) and its enantiomer are the ultimate carcinogens from benzo[a]pyrene, but the syn isomers are also produced.
1086	Induction of CYP1A1 by benzo[a]pyrene occurs via binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor in the cytosol, leading the transformed receptor to translocate to the nucleus where it dimerises with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator and then binds xenobiotic response elements in DNA located upstream of certain genes.  This process increases transcription of genes including CYP1A1, resulting in increased CYP1A1 protein production. This process is similar to induction of CYP1A1 by certain polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins. Seemingly, CYP1A1 activity in the intestinal mucosa prevents major amounts of ingested benzo[a]pyrene to enter portal blood and systemic circulation. Intestinal, but not hepatic, expression of CYP1A1 depends on TOLL-like receptor 2 (TLR2), which is a eucaryotic receptor for bacterial surface structures such as lipoteichoic acid. Moreover, benzo[a]pyrene has been found to activate a transposon, LINE1, in humans.
1087	Like cocaine, (–)-cis-CPCA and (+)-CPCA bind to the dopamine transporter and inhibit dopamine uptake, stimulate motor activity in rodents and completely substitute for cocaine in discrimination tests. Pretreatment with (–)-cis-CPCA or (+)-CPCA enhances the cocaine discriminative stimulus in rats. However, there are a number of differences; the locomotor stimulant effects of the piperidine derivatives are much less than those induced by cocaine, and pretreating mice with (–)-cis-CPCA or (+)-CPCA does not increase cocaine induced convulsions, and actually reduced cocaine induced locomotor stimulation. The (–)-cis-CPCA isomer has similar reinforcing effects to cocaine as shown by fixed-ratio self-administration tests in rats, but (+)-CPCA has a flat dose-response curve, and similarly while (–)-cis-CPCA and cocaine had nearly identical break points in a "punished responding" (?) self-administration test, (+)-CPCA had a lower break point than either of the other drugs.
1088	The generally lower efficacy of (+)-CPCA in locomotor and methamphetamine discrimination tests could result from the differential selectivity of the two isomers for the DAT relative to the SERT. That is, if serotonin receptor activation is requisite for maximal efficacy, the difference SERT affinity between (–)-cis-CPCA and (+)-CPCA might play a contributory role in accounting for the differences in the observed pharmacology. Catecholamine selective drugs, like TMP (methylphenidate), are reported to possess decent abuse potential though, so it is not easy to gauge why (+)-CPCA does not entice a strong self-administration propensity.
1089	In summary, (+)-CPCA has lower potency and efficacy than cocaine in increasing locomotor activity in rodents. (+)-CPCA only manages to produce partial methamphetamine-like discriminative stimulus effects, although it is fully cocaine-like in cocaine-trained animals. (+)-CPCA  has lower reinforcing potential than cocaine as assessed by fixed and progressive ratio IV self-administration tests in rats, with its reinforcing effects confirmed by rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, (+)-CPCA dose dependently antagonizes cocaine-induced locomotion and potentiates the discriminative stimulus effects of a low dose of cocaine. (+)-CPCA, unlike cocaine, does not enhance cocaine-induced convulsions. These results suggest that (+)-CPCA completely mimics certain behavioral actions of cocaine, whereas acting like a weak partial agonist in others, including its ability to attenuate cocaine-induced increase in locomotion and to serve as a positive reinforcing agent in rodents. Thus, (+)-CPCA may have potential utility in the treatment of cocaine addiction, and also offer valuable pharmacological information, furthering our understanding of cocaine's mechanism of action, because it exhibits fundamental differences from other related DARI molecules.
1090	The rational design of ligands with a predetermined potency at and selectivity for monoamine transporters is hindered by the lack of knowledge about the 3D structure of these targets. In cases where the 3D structure of the binding site in a target protein is not well defined, as is the case for the monoamine transporter proteins, one can perform ligand-based design to develop a pharmacophore. That is, by studying the conformational properties of a series of pharmacologically similar compounds, one can form hypotheses regarding the pharmacophore. Most of the potent tropane-based inhibitors, inc. coca, are believed to have at least 3 major interactions with the transporter binding site: one ionic or H-bonding interaction at the basic nitrogen, one dipole-dipole or H-bonding interaction of the ester group, and an interaction of the aryl group with a lipophilic binding pocket. This model was successfully used for the design of a novel piperidine-based DAT inhibitor, that is economically affordable to manufacture.
1091	Although the in vivo metabolism of (+)-CPCA is also likely to involve N-demethylation, metabolism to the corresponding free acid, to give a compound inactive at all monoamine transporters, will probably be the predominant pathway in vivo. It was reasoned that metabolism via esterase action can be avoided by replacing the ester group with a bioisosteric group that is more stable to metabolic degradation. In previous studies, it was found that oxadiazole, although cocaine-like in activity, exhibits a significantly longer duration of action due to slower rate of metabolism. In general, relative to the corresponding N-methyl compounds, the norpiperidines exhibited an increased activity at the SERT/NET and only modest changes at the DAT.
1092	An interesting difference between cocaine, ester 1a, alcohol 2a, and norester 1b is that the latter two compounds are substantially longer acting than cocaine in locomotor activity tests in mice. Although prolonged action is anticipated from compounds like alcohol 2a and oxadiazole 3a which lack the 3α ester group and so are more difficult to metabolise, this is not expected for the  norester 1b, because the 3α ester group should be just as easily hydrolysed as the ester group of cocaine and 1a. Another result of N-demethylation is an initial depressant action of 1b followed by delayed locomotor stimulation, which might be due to interaction with GABA receptors or mGlu5.
1093	In an earlier study, it was found that 3α-amido and bulky 3α-oxadiazoyl nocaine ligands, which possess greater stability relative to the ester functional group, and are therefore more attractive as potential therapies, are inactive. This result led to the hypothesis that the binding site of the DAT and NET in close proximity to the 3α-position of the piperidine ring is compact and cannot accommodate bulky, sterically occluded substituents, like the 3-substituted 1,2,4-oxadiazolyl groups. It was reasoned that introduction of a methylene spacer would confer improved monoamine transporter binding affinity upon the resultant molecules.
1094	A generally recognized pharmacophore model for cocaine and phenyltropanes comprises two electrostatic interactions of the basic nitrogen and the ester group of the C-2 substituent, and one hydrophobic interaction of the C-3 aryl group. This model has been disputed because of the finding that in certain compounds neither the basic N nor the ester group was necessary for high binding affinity and inhibition of MAR. Instead, a hydrophobic pocket was proposed to exist in the vicinity of the C-2 carbon. Carroll et al., however, provided further evidence for an electrostatic interaction at the C-2β-position in a later study.
1095	Other models proposed for the DAT binding site include a linear fashion binding pocket for the 3β-substituted phenyltropane analogs, and a prohibited conical region about 5.5–10 Å distant from the 3α-substituted piperidine ring. Noticeably, high potency at the DAT of dimeric piperidine-based esters and amides suggested that the flexible linker combining the two piperidine units was able to adjust its orientation and to avoid unfavorable interactions with the binding site. All these lines of evidence suggest that the DAT binding site is much more complicated than the proposed pharmacophore models.
1096	In an attempt to uncover the details of the DAT binding site, a number of 3D-QSAR studies were performed. Several QSAR/CoMFA studies focused on phenyltropanes concluded that an increased negative electrostatic potential in the regions around the 3β-substituent of the tropane ring and the para-position of the phenyl ring favored high potency in inhibiting the MATs. Wright et al. studied the role of the 3β-substituent of tropanes in binding to the DAT and blocking DA re-uptake. Their CoMFA model indicated that the 3β-substituent binding site is barrel-shaped and hydrophobic interactions make a dominant contribution to the binding, which is consistent with the studies of 3α-substituted tropane analogs reported by Newman et al. Newman and co-authors also studied N-substituted tropanes and concluded that the steric interaction of the N-substituent with the DAT is a principal factor for the binding affinity.
1097	Both "normal" and "unnatural" enantiomers of various opioid analgesic drugs including morphine, meperidine, fentanyl, methadone and buprenorphine, as well as some otherwise inactive metabolites like morphine-3-glucuronide, have been found to act as agonists of TLR4, and chronic use of these drugs consequently causes constant low-level release of TNF-α and IL-1β as well as other downstream effects. This is thought to be involved in various adverse properties of opioid analgesic drugs, such as loss of efficacy with extended use and the associated development of tolerance and dependence, as well as the development of side effects such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, which can cause long-term use of opioid analgesics to not only fail to treat neuropathic pain, but ultimately exacerbate it.
1098	Several opioid antagonist drugs were found to act as antagonists for TLR4, including naloxone and naltrexone. However it was found that not only the "normal" (-) enantiomers, but also the "unnatural" (+) enantiomers of these drugs acted as TLR4 antagonists (though (+)-nalmefene was inactive). Since (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone lack affinity for opioid receptors, they do not block the effects of opioid analgesic drugs, and so can be used to counteract the TLR4-mediated side effects of opioid agonists without affecting analgesia, though (+)-naloxone does reduce the reinforcing effects of opioid drugs. (+)-Naloxone was also found to be neuroprotective, and both (+)-naloxone and (+)-naltrexone are effective in their own right at treating symptoms of neuropathic pain in animal models. However (+)-naloxone was also found to reduce the effects of stimulant drugs, suggesting additional actions beyond TLR4 antagonism (possibly as a sigma receptor antagonist), that might potentially result in unwanted side effects or drug interactions.
1099	The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.8–1.7 AU once every 17 months (509 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.32 and an inclination of 15° with respect to the ecliptic. Its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance is 0.0449 AU (6,720,000 km). This makes the body a potentially hazardous asteroid, because its MOID is less than 0.05 AU and its diameter is greater than 150 meters. The first precovery was obtained at Palomar Observatory in 1953, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 39 years prior to its discovery.
1100	It has a semi-major axis, orbital period and orbital eccentricity close to that of a plutino. The orbital periods of plutinos cluster around 247.2 years (1.5 times Neptune's orbital period), close to 2002 KX14's orbital period. However, 2002 KX14 is not a plutino, as it is not actually in a resonance with Neptune, and it may have formed near its present nearly circular orbit lying almost perfectly on the ecliptic. This TNO may have remained dynamically cold since its formation, and thus its orbit may not have been a direct result of significant perturbations from Neptune during its migration to the outer solar system. The Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) currently classifies it as a cubewano (classical) based on a 10-million-year integration of the orbit.
1101	2004 EW95 is currently 27.0 AU from the Sun, and came to perihelion (q=26.98 AU) in April 2018.  This means that this object is currently inside the orbit of the planet Neptune.  Like Pluto, this plutino spends part of its orbit closer to the Sun than Neptune is even though their orbits are controlled by Neptune. (Probable dwarf planet Huya and plutino (15875) 1996 TP66 are also currently inside the orbit of Neptune.) Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) show that over the next 10 million years 2004 EW95 can acquire a perihelion distance (qmin) as small as 24.6 AU.
1102	Unlike the majority of small objects in the Kuiper belt observed so far, the visible spectrum of 2004 EW95 has two features, each respectively associated with ferric oxides and phyllosilicates. The presence of a phyllosilicate feature in the spectrum of a minor planet indicates that the rocky component of its composition has been altered by the presence of liquid water at some point since its formation. For this to have occurred on 2004 EW95 in its current orbit and at temperatures of ~35K, significant quantities of thermal energy would have been required. While this energy could have been delivered by a very large chance collision, the strong overall similarity between the modern C-type asteroids in the outer asteroid belt and 2004 EW95 suggests that these objects formed in the same region of the early Sun's protoplanetary disk, much closer to the Sun and at higher temperatures.
1103	(121514) 1999 UJ7 is a small asteroid orbiting near the L4 point of Mars (60 degrees ahead Mars on its orbit). As of September 2011, it is the only known asteroid to orbit the leading L4 point of Mars, although at least three other asteroids orbit Mars's trailing L5 point: 5261 Eureka, (101429) 1998 VF31, and 2007 NS2. Not only does (121514) 1999 UJ7 orbit on the other side of Mars from other similar asteroids, its spectrum is different as well, which is puzzling because all of the Martian trojans seem to be in very stable orbits.
1104	Due to similarity in the measured brightness of (121514) 1999 UJ7 with other Martian trojans, it is thought to be a small asteroid with an effective diameter on the order of 1 kilometer (0.62 mi). Its spectrum suggests that it is an X-type asteroid, which is different from 5261 Eureka and 1998 VF31, and is somewhat puzzling since different mineral compositions suggest different origins for the two groups of asteroids. The long lifetime of the orbits for these asteroids makes the possibility of one or more of them being interlopers unlikely, however. This suggests that either one or more of the Martian trojans was captured in such a way as to give it a long-term stable orbit (and it is therefore not a primordial Martian asteroid), or that some fusion or combination of previous asteroids resulted in the presently observed ones. The Yarkovsky effect may provide a potential capture mechanism but not enough is known about the shapes of these objects to provide a useful Yarkovsky model.
1105	According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, 2002 XU93 measures 170 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an low albedo of 0.04. The Johnston's archive gives a mean-diameter of 164 kilometers (102 mi) and albedo  of 0.038 from various measurement, while astronomer Michael Brown gives an albedo of 0.04 and a diameter of 180 kilometers (110 mi) from radiometric observations, listing an absolute magnitude of 7.9. Due to its small size, Brown does not consider it to be dwarf-planet candidate, grouping it into the "probably not"-category of his classification scheme (also see list of candidates).
1106	1998 US24 is a dark Jovian asteroid in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.8 AU once every 11 years and 12 months (4,367 days; semi-major axis of 5.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in February 1954, more than 44 years prior to its official discovery observation at Anderson Mesa.
1107	1994 CC was discovered by Spacewatch's Jim Scotti at Kitt Peak National Observatory on 3 February 1994. In June 2009 it was shown to be a triple system, i.e. the largest body is orbited by two satellites; only about one percent (1%) of near-Earth asteroids observed by a radar are found to be triple systems such as this one. The only other unambiguously identified triple asteroids in the near-Earth population are (153591) 2001 SN263, which was discovered to be a triple system in 2008, and 3122 Florence, which was found to be a triple system in 2017.
1108	A team of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (Pasadena, California) scientists led by Marina Brozovic and Lance Benner, made the discovery using radar imaging at NASA's Goldstone Solar System Radar on June 12 and June 14, 2009. They showed that the near-Earth asteroid 1994 CC is a triple system, which encountered Earth within 2.52 million kilometers on June 10, 2009. This relatively close approach to Earth made the discovery possible, as before the approach, scientists knew very little about this asteroid. In fact, 1994 CC is only the second triple system known in the near-Earth objects population.
1109	(137924) 2000 BD19, provisional designation 2000 BD19, is a 970-meter asteroid and near-Earth object with the second smallest perihelion of any numbered asteroid (0.092 AU—38% of Mercury's orbital radius). With its high eccentricity, not only does 2000 BD19 get very close to the Sun, but it also travels relatively far away from it. It has the third largest aphelion of any numbered Aten asteroid and is one of a small group of Aten asteroids that is also a Mars grazer. Its orbital elements indicate that may be an extinct comet. It hasn't been seen displaying cometary activity so far.
1110	Newly discovered asteroid 2003 QQ47 has received considerable media attention over the last few days because it had a small chance of colliding with the Earth in the year 2014 and was rated a "1" on the Torino Impact Hazard Scale, which goes from 0 to 10. The odds of collision in 2014, as estimated by JPL's Sentry impact monitoring system, peaked at 1 chance in 250,000, a result which was posted on our Impact Risk Page on Saturday, August 30, 2003. Impact events at the Torino Scale 1 level certainly merit careful monitoring by astronomers, but these events do not warrant public concern. In fact, each year several newly discovered asteroids reach Torino Scale 1 for a brief period after discovery; 2003 QQ47 is the fourth such case this year.
1111	(143651) 2003 QO104, provisional designation 2003 QO104, is a stony asteroid, slow rotator and suspected tumbler on a highly eccentric orbit, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Amor and Apollo group, respectively. It was discovered on 31 August 2003, by astronomers of the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking program at the Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii, United States. The Q-type asteroid has a rotation period of 114.4 hours and possibly an elongated shape. It measures approximately 2.3 kilometers (1.4 miles) in diameter and belongs the largest potentially hazardous asteroids known to exist.
1112	Several rotational lightcurve of this asteroid were obtained from photometric observations during its close approach to the Earth in 2009. Analysis of the best-rated lightcurve – obtained by Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in collaboration with Robert Stephens and Albino Carbognani – gave a well-defined rotation period of 114.4 hours with a high brightness amplitude of 1.60 magnitude (U=3), which is indicative of an elongated shape. With a period of more than 100 hours, 2003 QO104 is a slow rotator as most asteroids typically rotate every 2 to 20 hours once around their axis. The asteroid also shows several characteristics of a non-principal axis-rotation, which is commonly known as tumbling.
1113	2005 RM43 is considered likely to be a dwarf planet by both Brown and Tancredi. Based on an absolute magnitude of 4.4, the body's diameter could be anywhere in the range of 350 to 800 kilometres (km), depending on its albedo, the surface reflectivity of the object. Johnston's Archive gives an estimate of 584 km, based on an assumed albedo of 0.09. Brown estimates a diameter of 524 km, based on an absolute magnitude of 4.8 and an assumed albedo of 0.08. A stellar occultation by 2005 RM43 in December 2018 gave a minimum diameter of 458 km.
1114	The surface is covered by water ice as attested by deep absorption at 1.5 and 2 μm in the infrared spectrum and neutral (i.e. non-red) colour. Scattering models reveal that the observed water ice is, at least in a significant fraction, crystalline and organics, detected on the surface of many TNOs, are completely absent.These physical and orbital characteristics common with Haumea led to suggestion that 2005 RR43 is a member of the Haumea collisional family. The object, together with other members of the family ((19308) 1996 TO66, (24835) 1995 SM55, (55636) 2002 TX300 and (120178) 2003 OP32), would be created from ice mantle ejected from the proto-Haumea as result of a collision with another large (around 1,660 kilometres (1,030 mi)) body.
1115	The asteroid came to perihelion on 13 October 2020 when it passed the Sun going 88 kilometers per second (320,000 kilometers per hour). The asteroid was not more than 60 degrees from the Sun until 26 November 2020 and was observed by Goldstone radar on 27 November 2020. On 29 November 2020 the asteroid passed 0.02876 AU (4.302 million km; 11.19 LD) from Earth. Even the 2018 orbit solution had a known accuracy of roughly ± 150 km for the close approach. With the radar observations the close approach distance is known with an accuracy of roughly ± 5 km.
1116	In 2008, scientists using the planetary radar at Arecibo Observatory discovered that the object is orbited by two satellites, when the triple asteroid made a close approach to Earth of 0.066 AU (nearly 10 million kilometers). The largest body (preliminarily called Alpha) is spheroid in shape, with principal axes of 2.8±0.1 km, 2.7±0.1 km, and 2.9±0.3 km, with an effective diameter of 2.5±0.3 km and a density of 1.1±0.2 g/cm3. The satellites, named Beta and Gamma, are several times smaller in size. Beta is 0.77±0.12 km in diameter and Gamma 0.43±0.14 km.
1117	The Spitzer Space Telescope has estimated this object to be about 575 kilometres (357 mi) in diameter, but 2012 estimates from the Herschel Space Observatory estimate the diameter as closer to 339 kilometres (211 mi). It is not a detached object, since its perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) is under the influence of Neptune. Light-curve-amplitude analysis suggests that it is a spheroid. Tancredi presents "in the form of a decision tree, the set of questions to be considered in order to classify an object as an icy 'dwarf planet'." They find that (15874) 1996 TL66 is very probably a dwarf planet. Mike Brown's website, using a radiometrically determined diameter of 344 kilometres (214 mi), lists it as a possible dwarf planet.
1118	(15874) 1996 TL66 orbits the Sun with a semi-major axis of 83.9 AU but is currently only 35 AU from the Sun with an apparent magnitude of 21. In 2007, the Spitzer Space Telescope estimated it to have a low albedo with a diameter of about 575±115 km. More-recent measurements in 2012 by the 'TNOs are Cool' research project and reanalysis of older data have resulted in a new estimate of these figures. It is now assumed that it has a higher albedo and the diameter was revised downward to 339±20 km. Light-curve-amplitude analysis shows only small deviations, suggesting (15874) 1996 TL66 is a spheroid with small albedo spots and may be a dwarf planet.
1119	(15875) 1996 TP66, provisional designation 1996 TP66, is a resonant trans-Neptunian object of the plutino population, located in the outermost region of the Solar System, approximately 154 kilometers (96 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 11 October 1996, by astronomers Jane Luu, David C. Jewitt and Chad Trujillo at the Mauna Kea Observatories, Hawaii, in the United States. The very reddish RR-type with a highly eccentric orbit has been near its perihelion around the time of its discovery. This minor planet was numbered in 2000 and has since not been named. It is probably not a dwarf planet candidate.
1120	It orbits the Sun at a distance of 26.3–52.0 AU once every 244 years and 10 months (89,435 days; semi-major axis of 39.14 AU). Its orbit has a notably high eccentricity of 0.33 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. Among the plutinos, 1996 TP66 has one of the most elliptical orbits, with a perihelion almost halfway between Uranus (19.2 AU) and Neptune (30.1 AU). The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Mauna Kea in October 1996. Calculations by the Minor Planet Center in 1997 showed that the eccentric orbit of 1996 TP66 comes within 6.9 AU of Uranus and stays more than 22.6 AU from Neptune over a 14,000-year period centered on the present.
1121	1996 TP66 has a RR taxonomic class, with "very red" surface in the visible (rather than a "neutral" or "grey-blue" one for objects of the BB class) and a flat featureless infrared spectrum. In 2015, Irina Belskaya published the following color indices: B–V (1.050), V–R (0.660) and V–I (1.310). The resulting B–R magnitude is 1.71. These indices agree with the results obtained by the Herschel Space Observatory (Mommert): B–V (1.030), V–R (0.660) and V–I (1.320), and also agree with previous measurements by Olivier Hainaut: B–V (1.031), V–R (0.655) and V–I (1.324), as well as B–V (0.984), V–R (0.654) and V–I (11.337) from in 2012 and 2002, respectively. The numerous results are summarized at the Small Body Data Ferret.
1122	According to the survey carried out by the Herschel Space Telescope using its PACS instrument, 1996 TP66 measures 154.0+28.8−33.7 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.074+0.063−0.031. The results supersedes a previous study that gave a much larger diameter of 350 kilometers with a lower albedo of 0.03. According to Michael Brown, it is "probably not" a dwarf planet candidate, due to its relatively small diameter estimated at 158 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.10 and derives a diameter of 139.81 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 7.39.
1123	In August 2013, Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies observed 1998 MA11 over three nights. However no meaningful rotational lightcurve could be determined, as the lightcurve's amplitude never varied more than 0.02 magnitude. A period of 11.17 hours was only derived for demonstration purpose (U=2-). In December 2015, Stephens obtained an improved lightcurve with a rotation period of 250±5 hours and a brightness variation of 0.30 magnitude (U=2-). This time the asteroid was observed on 16 nights over a period of one month. The photometric observations also revealed that this object possibly has a non-principal axis rotation, which is commonly known as tumbling.
1124	Being a member of the Aten asteroids, 2002 NN4 orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.50–1.26 AU once every 10 months (300 days; semi-major axis of 0.88 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.43 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed by the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking on Palomar Observatory on 2 July 2002, or seven nights prior to its official discovery observation by LINEAR. This asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.0069 AU (1,030,000 km), which corresponds to 2.7 lunar distances (LD).
1125	It was scheduled to be observed by Goldstone radar in May 2013. It has a well determined orbit and made a close approach to Earth on 23 May 2013, at a distance of 0.0387 AU (5,790,000 km; 3,600,000 mi). It is due to make another close pass on 23 May 2131, coming as close as 0.0248 AU. It was discovered on 21 July 2002 by astronomers of the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking survey at Palomar Observatory in California. With an absolute magnitude of 18.8, the diameter is estimated to between 460 and 1030 meters.
1126	(172034) 2001 WR1, provisional designation 2001 WR1, is a sub-kilometer near-Earth object of the Amor group, approximately 650 meters (2,100 feet) in diameter. The S-type asteroid has been identified as a potential flyby target of the Hayabusa2 mission. It was discovered on 17 November 2001, by astronomers with the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at the Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site near Socorro, New Mexico, in the United States. The asteroid has a rotation period of 8.0 hours and possibly an elongated shape. It remains unnamed since its numbering in December 2007.
1127	2001 WR1 is an Amor asteroid – a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. The object orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.02–1.54 AU once every 17 months (527 days; semi-major axis of 1.28 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.20 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation in February 1953, more than 48 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro. The precovery was taken at Palomar Observatory and published by the Digitized Sky Survey.
1128	(17511) 1992 QN is a small, bright Apollo asteroid discovered on August 29 1992 by American astronomers Eleanor Helin and Jeff Alu at the Palomar Observatory, California, United States. It is a near-Earth asteroid whose orbit crosses that of Mars and Earth (a Mars and Earth-crossing asteroid). On January 18 1996, it passed Earth at a distance of 0.158848 AU (23.763 million km), and on July 12 2027, it will pass our planet again at a distance of 0.161858 AU (24.214 million km). (17511) 1992 QN's orbit is similar to that of Apollo asteroid 2010 JG.
1129	China plans to land a probe on 1996 FG3 after 2020 as part of its asteroid exploration mission. The mission includes plans for fly-by of three asteroids (one of them is 99942 Apophis), and land on 1996 FG3 to conduct in situ sampling analysis on the surface, according to Ji Jianghui, a researcher at the Purple Mountain Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a member of the expert committee for scientific goal argumentation of deep space exploration in China. The probe is also expected to conduct a fly-by of a third asteroid to be determined at a later time. The entire mission is expected to take about six years.
1130	During the photometric observations in December 1998, the binary nature of this asteroid was revealed. It was the first binary near-Earth asteroid for which eclipse events were detected in the visible spectrum. The binary system has a diameter ratio of 0.28, a density of 1.4 g/cm3, and an ecliptic latitude of -84° for its mutual spin axis. The asteroid moon has a diameter of approximately 490 meters and an orbital period of 16.1508 hours. Its orbit is nearly circular, with an eccentricity of 0.1 and a semi-major axis of approximately 3.4 primary radii. The moon's rotation period remains unknown.
1131	2005 UP156 is an Amor asteroid that approaches the orbit of Earth from beyond but does not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1–3.1 AU once every 3 years and 1 month (1,124 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.47 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery image taken by NEAT at Palomar Observatory in November 2002, almost four years prior to its official discovery observation. Due to its high eccentricity, the asteroid is also a Mars-crosser, which means that it also crosses the orbit of Mars (at 1.666 AU).
1132	Arecibo radar observations on 5–6 March 2012 showed that 1999 RD32 is approximately 5 kilometers (3 mi) in diameter and has an estimated albedo of only 0.04. Other sources calculate a smaller diameter of 1.63 kilometers based on a dated assumption, that the object is a stony rather than a carbonaceous asteroid. The two visible lobes suggest that 1999 RD32 is a tight binary asteroid or contact binary. About 10–15% of near-Earth asteroids larger than 200 meters are expected to be contact binary asteroids with two lobes in mutual contact.
1133	To construct the triangle group, start with a hyperbolic triangle with angles π/2, π/3, π/7. This triangle, the smallest hyperbolic Schwarz triangle, tiles the plane by reflections in its sides. Consider then the group generated by reflections in the sides of the triangle, which (since the triangle tiles) is a non-Euclidean crystallographic group (discrete subgroup of hyperbolic isometries) with this triangle for fundamental domain; the associated tiling is the order-3 bisected heptagonal tiling. The (2,3,7) triangle group is defined as the index 2 subgroup consisting of the orientation-preserving isometries, which is a Fuchsian group (orientation-preserving NEC group).
1134	(208996) 2003 AZ84 is a trans-Neptunian object with a possible moon from the outer regions of the Solar System. It is approximately 940 kilometers across its longest axis, as it has an elongated shape. It belongs to the plutinos – a group of minor planets named after its largest member Pluto – as it orbits in a 2:3 resonance with Neptune in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered on 13 January 2003, by American astronomers Chad Trujillo and Michael Brown during the NEAT survey using the Samuel Oschin telescope at Palomar Observatory.
1135	It is considered a very likely dwarf planet by astronomers Gonzalo Tancredi and Michael Brown. However, Grundy et al. conclude that objects such as this, in the size range of 400–1000 km, with albedos less than ≈0.2 and densities of ≈1.2 g/cm3 or less, have likely never compressed into fully solid bodies, let alone differentiated or collapsed into hydrostatic equilibrium, and so are highly unlikely to be dwarf planets. It is possibly the largest unnamed object in the Solar System, given the large measurement uncertainties of all unnamed objects with greater best-estimate diameters.
1136	2003 AZ84 orbits the Sun at an average distance of 39.4 astronomical units (AU) and completes a full orbit in 247 years. It is in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune; 2003 AZ84 completes two orbits around the Sun for every three orbits completed by Neptune. Since it is in a 2:3 resonance with Neptune, 2003 AZ84 is classified as a plutino. Its orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by 13.6 degrees. The orbit of 2003 AZ84 is moderately eccentric, with an orbital eccentricity of 0.183. As of July 2019, 2003 AZ84 is currently located 44.43 AU (6.647×109 km) from the Sun. It had approached its aphelion (furthest distance from the Sun) in 1982 and will come to its perihelion (closest distance to the Sun) in 2107. Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey show that over the next 10 million years 2003 AZ84 will not come closer (qmin) than 31.6 AU from the Sun (it will stay farther away than Neptune).
1137	In October 2013, a rotational lightcurve was obtained of this asteroid from photometric observations in the R-band by astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California. It gave a rotation period of 1007.7 hours – or nearly 42 days – with an assigned error margin of ±86 hours. According to the Light Curve Data Base, it is the 13th slowest rotating minor planet known to exist among more than 15,000 observed small Solar System bodies. Due to its high brightness variation of 0.86 magnitude, the body is likely to have a non-spheroidal shape (U=2). As of 2018, no follow-up observation have been published.
1138	2000 WD49 is a dark Jovian asteroid in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 9 months (4,280 days; semi-major axis of 5.16 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 21° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as 1994 NE6 at the La Silla Observatory in July 1994, more than 6 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.
1139	In November 2011, a rotational lightcurve of 2000 AN146 was obtained from photometric observations by Robert Stephens at the Goat Mountain Astronomical Research Station (G79) in collaboration with Linda French at Illinois Wesleyan University and Daniel Coley at the Trojan Station of Center for Solar System Studies (U81), as well as Ralph Megna and Lawrence Wasserman. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of 8.69 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.27 magnitude (U=3-). The result supersedes a previous observation from a fragmentary lightcurve that gave a period of only 6.86 hours (U=1).
1140	(231937) 2001 FO32 is a near-Earth asteroid classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group. With an estimated diameter around 550 m (1,800 ft), it was discovered by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research at Socorro, New Mexico on 23 March 2001. The asteroid safely passed by Earth on 21 March 2021 16:03 UTC from a closest approach distance of 0.0135 AU (2.02 million km; 1.25 million mi), or 5.25 lunar distances (LD). During the day before closest approach, 2001 FO32 reached a peak apparent magnitude of 11.7 and was visible to ground-based observers with telescope apertures of at least 20 cm (8 in). It is the largest and one of the fastest asteroids to approach Earth within 10 LD (3.8 million km; 2.4 million mi) in 2021.
1141	2001 FO32 was discovered on 23 March 2001 by the Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research (LINEAR) at Lincoln Laboratory's Experimental Test Site in Socorro, New Mexico. The asteroid was first observed in the constellation Hydra at an apparent magnitude of 15.6. Shortly after discovery, follow-up observations were carried out by four other observatories until the asteroid's subsequent confirmation by the Minor Planet Center on 24 March 2003. The asteroid was given the provisional designation 2001 FO32 and was recognized as a potentially hazardous asteroid. The accredited LINEAR observers are M. Blythe, F. Shelly, M. Bezpalko, R. Huber, L. Manguso, and S. Adams.
1142	On 21 March 2021, 2001 FO32 passed by Earth from a distance of 0.0135 AU (2.02 million km; 1.25 million mi) or 5.25 LD and made its closest approach at 16:03 UTC. During the few days leading up to closest approach, 2001 FO32 steadily became brighter and peaked at apparent magnitude 11.7 on 21 March 2021 2:00 UTC. Although its maximum brightness was too faint to be seen with the naked eye, it was visible to observers using telescopes with apertures of at least 20 cm (8 in). Due to its highly inclined and eccentric orbit, its relative velocity to Earth during the close approach is 34.4 km/s (21.4 mi/s), making it one of the fastest asteroids to pass by Earth in 2021. By the time 2001 FO32 makes its closest approach to Earth, its solar elongation (angular separation from the Sun) would be 64°, too small to be observable from Earth.
1143	1998 VD30 is a dark Jupiter trojan in a 1:1 orbital resonance with Jupiter. It is located in the leading Greek camp at the Gas Giant's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of its orbit (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.7–5.7 AU once every 12 years (4,370 days; semi-major axis of 5.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation as 1986 WG9 at the Kiso Observatory in November 1986, or 12 years prior to its official discovery observation at Socorro.
1144	In February 2012 a deal was announced in which [24]7.ai and Microsoft would combine technologies for natural user interfaces (NUIs) and data analytics at cloud scale. Microsoft made an equity investor and transferred approximately 400 employees of the former Tellme Networks to [24]7.ai. At the same time, [24]7.ai acquired the call center automation developer Voxify, which had been based in Alameda, California, and was funded by investors such as Intel. In 2012, the company rebranded its business, adopting a new logo dropping the word "Customer" and putting square brackets around the "24". In January 2013 it announced it would market some internally developed software products for combining chat with analytics.
1145	The current product offering is developing sales and service-oriented software that encompasses big data, predictive analytics, virtual agents and real-time decisioning. It integrates different channels of communication, including web chat, mobile devices and interactive voice response, which incorporates the company's proprietary natural language technology. The company operates contact centers that outsource voice and chat agent services, for sales and support. Its largest customers are in telecommunications, financial services, retail, insurance, and travel industries. Its early offerings were contact center services with voice contact center agents. Contact centers were originally located in Bangalore and Hyderabad, India, and in the Philippines, but by 2007 (with about 7,000 total employees) expanded to Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Colombia to support Spanish-language customers.
1146	(24952) 1997 QJ4, also written as 1997 QJ4, is a plutino and as such, it is trapped in a 2:3 mean-motion resonance with Neptune. It was discovered on 28 August 1997 by Jane X. Luu, Chad Trujillo, David C. Jewitt and K. Berney. This object has a perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) at 30.463 AU and an aphelion (farthest approach from the Sun) at 48.038 AU, so it moves in a relatively eccentric orbit (0.224). It has an estimated diameter of 139 km; therefore, it is unlikely to be classified as a dwarf planet.
1147	(276033) 2002 AJ129, provisional designation 2002 AJ129, is a Mercury-crossing asteroid. It has the ninth-smallest perihelion of all numbered asteroids, after asteroids such as 2000 BD19, 2004 UL, and 2008 XM. It makes close approaches to all of the inner planets and asteroid 4 Vesta. The asteroid is estimated to be between 0.5–1.2 kilometers (0.3–0.7 mi) across. In January 2018 there was much media hype about this asteroid being classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid, although there is no known threat of an impact for hundreds if not thousands of years. The media has compared the size of the asteroid to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.
1148	It is a Mercury-, Venus-, Earth- and Mars-crossing asteroid. With an observation arc of 14 years, it has a well determined orbit and was last observed in 2016. It is classified as an Apollo asteroid because it is a near-Earth asteroid with a semi-major axis larger than Earth's. It is also categorized as a potentially hazardous asteroid, but that does not mean there is a near-term threat of an impact. It is a potentially hazardous asteroid merely as a result of its size (absolute magnitude H ≤ 22) and Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (Earth MOID ≤ 0.05 AU).
1149	As an Amor asteroid the orbit of 1998 QE2 is entirely beyond Earth's orbit. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–3.8 AU once every 3 years and 9 months (1,378 days; semi-major axis of 2.42 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.57 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The Earth minimum orbit intersection distance with the orbit of the asteroid is 0.035 AU (5,200,000 km; 3,300,000 mi), which translates into 13.4 lunar distances. As with many members of the Amor group, this asteroid has an aphelion beyond the orbit of Mars (at 1.66 AU) which also makes it a Mars-crosser.
1150	On 31 May 2013, 1998 QE2 approached within 0.039 AU (5,800,000 km; 3,600,000 mi) (15 lunar distances) of Earth at 20:59 UT (4:59 pm EDT). This was the closest approach the asteroid will make to Earth for at least the next two centuries. It is a very strong radar target for Goldstone from May 30 to June 9 and will be one for Arecibo from June 6 to June 12. At its closest approach the asteroid had an apparent magnitude of 11 and therefore required a small telescope to be seen.
1151	Goldstone radar observations on 29 May 2013 discovered that 1998 QE2 is orbited by a minor-planet moon approximately 600–800 meters in diameter. In radar images, the satellite appears brighter than 1998 QE2 because it is rotating significantly more slowly, which compresses the radar return of the satellite along the Doppler axis. This makes the satellite appear narrow and bright compared to 1998 QE2. The satellite orbits the primary every 32 hours with a maximum separation of 6.4 kilometers (4.0 mi).  Once the satellite's orbit is well determined, astronomers and astrophysicists will be able to determine the mass and density of 1998 QE2.
1152	(29075) 1950 DA, provisional designation 1950 DA, is a risk–listed asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 1.1 kilometers (0.68 miles) in diameter. It once had the highest known probability of impacting Earth. In 2002, it had the highest Palermo rating with a value of 0.17 for a possible collision in 2880. Since that time, the estimated risk has been updated several times. In December 2015, the odds of an Earth impact were revised to 1 in 8,300 (0.012%) with a Palermo rating of −1.42. As of 2018, It is listed on the Sentry Risk Table with the highest cumulative Palermo rating. 1950 DA is not assigned a Torino scale rating, because the 2880 date is over 100 years in the future. However, if the impact were less than 100 years in the future, the asteroid would have been given a Torino rating of 1.
1153	The studies showed that the asteroid has a mean diameter of 1.1 km, assuming that 1950 DA is a retrograde rotator. Optical lightcurve analysis by Lenka Sarounova and Petr Pravec shows that its rotation period is 2.1216±0.0001 hours. Due to its short rotation period and high radar albedo, 1950 DA is thought to be fairly dense (more than 3.5 g/cm3, assuming that it has no internal strength) and likely composed of nickel–iron. In August 2014, scientists from the University of Tennessee determined that 1950 DA is a rubble pile rotating faster than the breakup limit for its density, implying the asteroid is held together by van der Waals forces rather than gravity.
1154	1950 DA made a distant approach to Earth on 5 February 2021. However, at that time it was half an AU away from Earth, preventing more useful astrometrics and timing that occurs when an object is closer to Earth. The next close approach that presents a good opportunity to observe the asteroid will be on 2 March 2032, when it will be 0.075 AU (11.2 million km) from Earth. The following table lists next five approaches closer than 0.10 AU. By 2136 the close approach solutions are becoming notably more divergent.
1155	Main-belt asteroid 78 Diana (~125 km in diameter) will pass about 0.003 AU (450,000 km; 280,000 mi) from 1950 DA on 5 August 2150. At that distance and size, Diana will perturb 1950 DA enough so that the change in trajectory is notable by 2880 (730 years later). In addition, over the intervening time, 1950 DA's rotation will cause its orbit to slightly change as a result of the Yarkovsky effect. If 1950 DA continues on its present orbit, it may approach Earth on 16 March 2880, though the mean trajectory passes many millions of kilometres from Earth, so 1950 DA does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth. As of the 7 December 2015 solution, the probability of an impact in 2880 is 1 in 8,300 (0.012%).
1156	2006 VW139 belongs to the exclusive class of main-belt comets, which display properties of both comets and asteroids. It is also a synchronous binary system and potentially the slowest rotator known to exist. The object was discovered by Spacewatch in 2006. Its binary nature was confirmed by the Hubble Space Telescope in September 2016. Both primary and its minor-planet moon are similar in mass and size, making it a true binary system. The components are estimated to measure 1.8 kilometers in diameter, orbiting each other at a wide separation of 104 kilometers every 135 days.
1157	The Spitzer Space Telescope estimated it to have a diameter of 726±123 km, while the Herschel Space Telescope estimated it to be 934±47 km. If the latter case is true, 2002 MS4 would be comparable in size to the dwarf planet Ceres, and would also be the largest Solar System object without a name as of 2020. 2002 MS4 is one of the 10 largest TNOs currently known and large enough to be considered a dwarf planet under the 2006 draft proposal of the IAU. A stellar occultation by 2002 MS4 was observed on 26 July 2019 from British Columbia, with a single chord of 831 km. Another stellar occultation on 19 August 2019 suggested that 2002 MS4 may be highly oblate in shape, with a projected dimension of 842 × 688 km. Another stellar occultation on 8 August 2020, with at least 21 positive detections, resulted in a projected size of 808 × 748 km.
1158	In February 2010, (308635) 2005 YU55 was rated 1 on the Torino Scale for a potential pass near Earth on 10 November 2103, that posed no unusual level of danger. On 19 April 2010, radar ranging by the Arecibo radio telescope reduced uncertainties about the orbit by 50%. This improvement eliminated any possibility of an impact with Earth within the next 100 years. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 22 April 2010 and as such it now has a rating of 0 on the Torino Scale. It is now known that on 10 November 2103 (308635) 2005 YU55 will be roughly 2 AU from Earth.
1159	On 8 November 2011 at 23:28 UT the asteroid passed 0.85 LD (330,000 km; 200,000 mi) from Earth. On 9 November 2011 at 07:13 UT the asteroid passed 0.6231 LD (239,500 km; 148,800 mi) from the Moon. During the close approach the asteroid reached about apparent magnitude 11, and would have been visible to experienced observers using high-end binoculars with an objective lens of 80+ mm if it were not for bright moonlight preventing a true dark sky. Since the gibbous moon did interfere with the viewing, observers trying to visually locate the asteroid required a telescope with an aperture of 6 inches (15 centimeters) or larger.
1160	On 8 November 2011, NASA released a statement mentioning a number of structures on the surface of the asteroid, which were detected as it passed near Earth. On 11 November 2011, higher-resolution images showed concavities, a ridge near the asteroid's equator, and numerous features interpreted as decameter-scale boulders. Shape modeling based on the radar images shows that YU55's shape is close to spheroidal, with maximum dimensions of 360±40 m, and an equator-aligned ridge. A 150–200 meter-long, ~20 meter-high rise forms a portion of the ridge-line, and the number of boulders on the surface is comparable to that seen on the asteroid 25143 Itokawa by the Hayabusa spacecraft.
1161	On 19 January 2029, (308635) 2005 YU55 will pass 0.0023 AU (340,000 km; 210,000 mi) from Venus. The close approach distance to Venus in 2029 will determine how close the asteroid will pass to Earth in 2041. Before the November 2011 observations, the uncertainties in the post-2029 trajectory showed that the asteroid would pass somewhere between 0.002 AU (300,000 km; 190,000 mi) and 0.3 AU (45,000,000 km; 28,000,000 mi) of Earth in 2041. Radar astrometry in November 2011 clarified the Earth passage in 2041 and beyond. As a result of the November 2011 radar observations, it is now known that (308635) 2005 YU55 will pass between 0.1017 AU (15,210,000 km; 9,450,000 mi) and 0.1020 AU of Earth on 12 November 2041. Using the current uncertainty region integrated until the future, the 2075 approach will be between 0.0013 AU (190,000 km; 120,000 mi) and 0.0021 AU (310,000 km; 200,000 mi).
1162	The orbit of 2006 SQ372 currently comes closer to Neptune than any of the other giant planets. More than half of the simulations of this object show that it gets too close to either Uranus or Neptune within the next 180 million years, sending it in a currently unknown direction. This makes it difficult to classify this object as only a centaur or a scattered disc object. The Minor Planet Center, which officially catalogues all trans-Neptunian objects, lists centaurs and SDOs together. (29981) 1999 TD10 is another such object that blurs the two categories.
1163	Given the extreme orbital eccentricity of this object, different epochs can generate quite different heliocentric unperturbed two-body best-fit solutions to the aphelion distance (maximum distance) of this object. With a 2005 epoch the object had an approximate period of about 22,000 years with aphelion at 1557 AU. But using a 2011 epoch shows a period of about 32,000 years with aphelion at 2006 AU. For objects at such high eccentricity, the Sun's barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates. Using JPL Horizons with an observed orbital arc of only 2.9 years, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2008-May-14 generate a semi-major axis of 796 AU and a period of 22,466 years.
1164	(309239) 2007 RW10 was discovered by the Palomar Distant Solar System Survey on September 9, 2007, with precovery images from 1988 (also taken at Palomar). At the time of discovery, this minor body was believed to be a Neptune trojan, but it is no longer listed as such. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory classifies (309239) 2007 RW10 as trans-Neptunian object butthe Minor Planet Center includes the object among centaurs. It movesin an orbit with an inclination of 36.2°, a semi-major axis of 30.18 AU, and an eccentricity of 0.3020. Herschel-PACS observations indicate that it has a diameter of 247 km.
1165	(309239) 2007 RW10 is currently following a quasi-satellite loop around Neptune. It has been a quasi-satellite of Neptune for about 12,500 years and it will remain in that dynamical state for another 12,500 years. Prior to the quasi-satellite dynamical state, (309239) 2007 RW10 was an L5 trojan and it will go back to that state soon after leaving its current quasi-satellite orbit. Its orbital inclination is the largest among known Neptune co-orbitals. It is also possibly the largest known object trapped in the 1:1 mean-motion resonance with any major planet.
1166	Jean Meeus suspected that (311999) 2007 NS2 was a Mars Trojan, and this was confirmed by Reiner Stoss's analysis of two sets of observations dating from 1998 on the MPC database. It was confirmed to be a Mars Trojan numerically in 2012. Recent calculations confirm that it is a stable L5 Mars Trojan asteroid with a libration period of 1310 years and an amplitude of 14°. These values as well as its short-term orbital evolution are similar to those of 5261 Eureka. Out of all known Mars Trojans, it currently has the smallest relative (to Mars) semimajor axis, 0.000059 AU.
1167	2008 AP129 orbits the Sun at a distance of 36.1–47.6 AU once every 270 years and 5 months (98,778 days; semi-major axis of 41.8 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 27° with respect to the ecliptic. It has 3 precovery observations back to 1989. Lightcurve analysis gave an ambiguous rotation period of 9.04 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.12 magnitude (U=2). Michael Brown considers it a probable dwarf planet with an estimated diameter of 496 kilometers and albedo of 0.07. 2008 AP129 has been identified as a member of the Haumea family in a dynamical study led by Proudfoot and Ragozzine in 2019.
1168	(332446) 2008 AF4 is a sub-kilometer asteroid, classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, which was listed on the Sentry Risk Table in January 2008 with a Torino Scale rating of 1. The asteroid showed a 1 in 71,000 chance of impact on 9 January 2089. It was briefly downgraded to Torino Scale 0 in February 2008, but still showed a cumulative 1 in 53,000 chance of an impact. In March it was back at Torino Scale 1 with a 1 in 28,000 chance of impact on 9 January 2089. By mid April 2008, it was back to Torino Scale 0. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 19 December 2009.
1169	(33340) 1998 VG44, also written as (33340) 1998 VG44, is a trans-Neptunian object. It has a 2:3 orbital resonance with the planet Neptune, similar to Pluto, classifying it as a plutino. Its average distance from the Sun is 39.083 AU with a perihelion of 29.354 AU and an aphelion at 48.813 AU. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.249, and is inclined by 3°. It is about 221 km in diameter, so it is unlikely to be classified as a dwarf planet. It was discovered on November 14, 1998, by J. A. Larsen, Nicole M. Danzl and A. Gleason at the Steward Observatory.
1170	At the time of its discovery, astronomers were trying to find the first Apohele asteroid (one that is always closer to the Sun than Earth). All asteroids known at the time that got closer to the Sun than Earth also crossed Earth's orbit. Earlier that year, David J. Tholen claimed to have spotted the first Apohele asteroid, which was dubbed 1998 DK36. However, the object was lost without being confirmed. Thus, 1993 DA remained the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion at 1.023 AU. When 1998 WT24 was discovered, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than 1993 DA, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. It lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when (415713) 1998 XX2 was discovered only a few weeks later (aphelion = 1.014 AU). Asteroids with even smaller aphelions were discovered until February 2003, when finally, an asteroid with an aphelion smaller than 1.000 AU was discovered. This was 163693 Atira, the first confirmed Apohele asteroid.
1171	1998 WT24 was the second asteroid discovered to be close enough to Venus as to be within the major planet's zone of influence. It is located at about the inner edge of the zone, while (99907) 1989 VA, the first asteroid discovered there, is at about the outer edge. It is possible for planets to capture asteroids located in their sphere of influences into co-orbital relationships such as Trojan and horseshoe asteroids. Because of its frequent close encounters with Mercury and Earth, however, it may prove difficult for Venus to keep 1998 WT24 in a co-orbital relationship for any length of time. Of the six objects in Venus's zone of influence, only one (2002 VE68) is currently a co-orbital.
1172	1998 WT24 is a potentially hazardous asteroid. That means its orbit takes it very close to Earth and if it were to collide with our planet, it would cause devastation on at least a regional scale. On 16 December 2001, it became the first PHA to be observed passing within 5 Lunar Distances (the average distance between Earth and the Moon) from Earth. Other asteroids have come closer, and numerous have even come closer than the Moon, but these have all been small asteroids, incapable of causing much damage to the planet, or much concern. The 2001 encounter was the closest known approach to Earth any PHA had made since (192642) 1999 RD32 passed by on 27 August 1969. However, 1999 RD32 was not discovered until September 1999 many years after its closest approach, so no one knew about 1999 RD32 in 1969.
1173	In September 2004, the well known PHA 4179 Toutatis came about 4 Lunar Distances from Earth. Due to its diameter being over ten times larger (5.7 km) and its closer approach, Toutatis at its closest (mag 8.9) was about half an apparent magnitude brighter than 1998 WT24 was at its closest (mag 9.5). However, Toutatis arrived during a full moon, and thus 1998 WT24's 2001 encounter is still the most easily observed flyby of an asteroid in history. It also made 1998 WT24 the first Near-Earth asteroid observed to be brighter than magnitude 10.
1174	1998 WT24 is a Mercury-crosser asteroid, a Venus-crosser asteroid, and an Earth-crosser asteroid. Because of its relatively low inclination (7.34°), it is able to come close to each of these planets. Its orbit takes it within 0.021 AU of Mercury's orbit, 0.0368 AU of Venus's orbit, and 0.00989 AU of Earth's orbit. It makes frequent encounters with these inner planets. The last time it came close to Mercury, Venus and Earth was 2010, 1977, and 12 November 2004, respectively. The most recent close approach to Earth was on 11 December 2015 at about 4.2 million kilometers (2.6 million miles, 11 lunar distances). The next visit of the asteroid to Earth's neighborhood will be on 11 November 2018, when it will make a relatively distant pass at about 20 million kilometers (12.5 million miles, 52 lunar distances). These encounters perturb its orbit parameters slightly, and each pass reduces its inclination further.
1175	From here, the newly liberated 2008 EV5 began to change via the forces referred to as the Yarkovsky and YORP effects. The Yarkovsky effect describes a small force that affects orbital motion. It is caused by sunlight; when objects heat up in the Sun, they reradiate the energy away as heat, which in turn creates a tiny thrust. This recoil acceleration is much weaker than solar and planetary gravitational forces, but it can produce substantial orbital changes over timescales ranging from many millions to billions of years. The same physical phenomenon also creates a thermal torque that probably caused 2008 EV5 to take on a top-like appearance.
1176	On 11 November 2024, 2009 HC82 will pass about 0.485 AU (72,600,000 km; 45,100,000 mi) from Earth, but with a record high relative velocity of about 283,000 km/h (78.66 km/s). Both Halley's Comet (254,000 km/h) and 55P/Tempel-Tuttle (252,800 km/h) have slightly lower relative velocities to Earth.Note however that when the asteroid is one astronomical unit from the sun (as it would be if it ever hit the earth), its relative speed will be less. On 2 February 2053, 2009 HC82 will pass about 0.08 AU from Venus. On 22 October 2060, it may pass about 0.004 AU (600,000 km; 370,000 mi) from Mars.
1177	Three months after its discovery on 6 December 1997 by James V. Scotti of the University of Arizona's Spacewatch Project, the asteroid was predicted to make an exceptionally close approach to Earth on 28 October 2028. Additional precovery observations of the asteroid from 1990 were quickly found that refined the orbit and it is now known the asteroid will pass the Earth on 26 October 2028, at a distance of 0.0062 AU (930,000 km; 580,000 mi), about 2.4 times the Earth–Moon distance. During the close approach, the asteroid should peak at about apparent magnitude 8.2, and will be visible in binoculars.
1178	On 11 March 1998, using a three-month observation arc, a faulty International Astronomical Union circular and press information sheet were put out that incorrectly concluded "that the asteroid was 'virtually certain' to pass within 80% of the distance to the Moon and stood a 'small...not entirely out of the question' possibility of hitting the Earth in 2028." But by 23 December 1997, it should have been clear that XF11 had no reasonable possibility of an Earth impact. Within hours of the announcement, independent calculations by Paul Chodas, Don Yeomans, and Karri Muinonen had calculated that the probability of Earth impact was essentially zero, and vastly less than the probability of impact from as-yet-undiscovered asteroids. Chodas (1999) concurs with Marsden (1999) that there was about 1 chance in a hundred thousand that XF11 could have passed through a keyhole—that is, until the 1990 precovery observations eliminated such possibilities. During the October 2002 close approach, the asteroid was observed by the 70-meter Goldstone radar dish, further refining the orbit.
1179	According to observations by the space-based Herschel and Spitzer telescopes, 1998 SN165 measures between 393 and 460 kilometers and its surface has a low albedo between 0.043 and 0.060. While Johnston's Archive adopts a diameter of 393 kilometers, astronomer Michael Brown gives a radiometric diameter of 473 kilometers and lists this object as a "probable" dwarf planet (400–500 km), which is the category with the second lowest certainty in his 5-class taxonomic system. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 334 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 5.5. A generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion with an albedo of 0.9 gives a diameter of 352 kilometers.
1180	On 26 January 2015 at 16:20 UTC, 2004 BL86 passed 1,199,600 km (745,400 mi), or 3.1 lunar distances, from Earth. The asteroid briefly peaked around apparent magnitude 9 and was near the celestial equator. The asteroid was visible in telescopes with objectives of 100 mm (4 in) or larger; high-end binoculars under a dark sky may also have worked. Near closest approach the asteroid was moving about 2.5 degrees per hour (2.5 arcseconds per second). The asteroid came to opposition (furthest elongation in the sky from the Sun) on 27 January 2015 at 04:37 UTC. Around 5:00 UTC, the asteroid was near M44 (the Beehive Cluster).
1181	The October 2012 observations have reduced the orbit uncertainties by more than a factor of 60, meaning that the Earth's position in February 2040 no longer falls within the range of possible future paths for the asteroid. On 4 February 2040 the asteroid will pass no closer than 0.0066 AU (990,000 km; 610,000 mi) (~2.6 LD) from Earth. Until 21 December 2012 it was listed on the Sentry Risk Table with a rating on the Torino Scale of Level 1. A Torino rating of 1 is a routine discovery in which a pass near the Earth is predicted that poses no unusual level of danger. It is estimated that an impact would produce the equivalent of 100 megatons of TNT, roughly twice that of the most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated (Tsar Bomba). This is powerful enough to damage a region at least a hundred miles wide.
1182	Virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the mid-2012 uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed four potential impacts between 2040 and 2047. It had a 1 in 500 chance of impacting the Earth on 5 February 2040. In September 2013, there was an opportunity to make additional observations of 2011 AG5 when it came within 0.98 AU (147,000,000 km; 91,000,000 mi) of Earth. The 2013 observations allowed a further refinement to the known trajectory. The asteroid will also pass 0.0121 AU (1,810,000 km; 1,120,000 mi) from the Earth on 3 February 2023. The 2023 gravitational keyhole was 227 miles (365 kilometers) wide. With a Palermo Technical Scale of -1.00, the odds of impact by 2011 AG5 were about 10 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact.
1183	The size of an object can be ascertained once its absolute magnitude (H) and its albedo (the proportion of light it reflects) are known.  When 2009 YE7 was first discovered, it was believed to have an absolute magnitude (H) of 2.8, which would have made it the first bright KBO found from the southern hemisphere. 2009 YE7 has an absolute magnitude (H) of 4.5. Since 2009 YE7 has an absolute magnitude dimmer than (H=1), it will not be overseen by two naming committees and will not automatically be listed as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). This value would've made it the eighth-intrinsically-brightest known trans-Neptunian object, but it was later found to be much dimmer. It has an absolute magnitude (H) of 4.5, which would make it a good dwarf-planet candidate when using an albedo of 0.09. However, it is probably much smaller than previously thought, since it is also suspected of being a highly reflective icy member of the Haumea family.
1184	The asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 2,440,000 km (0.0163 AU), which corresponds to 6.4 lunar distances (LD). On 10 February 2014, it passed Earth close to this theoretical minimum distance at 6.25 LD, or 2,400,000 km (0.016032 AU). This makes is a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA), a body with a threatening close approach to the Earth, due to its low MOID and large size (absolute magnitude of 18.9). PHAs are defined as objects with an absolute magnitude of 22 or brighter – which generically corresponds to a diameter of approximately 140 meters – and a MOID that is smaller than 0.05 AU or 19.5 LD.
1185	2012 SQ31 a member of the Flora family (402), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 5 months (1,242 days; semi-major axis of 2.26 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Haleakala-AMOS, Hawaii, in December 2005, four years prior to its official discovery observation.
1186	On 11 August 2004, the asteroid was already observed as 2004 PR107 by astronomers at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, but became a lost minor planet until 2012 due to a lack of follow-up observations. During this time, and with only two observations taken on the same day, it was thought to be a trans-Neptunian object with a semi-major axis of 46 AU. Michael Brown listed it as a likely a dwarf planet on his website with an estimated diameter of 555 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 4.6 and an assumed albedo of 0.09.
1187	Oxyallyl cations (propenyliumolates) may be generated under reductive, mildly basic, or photolytic conditions. Reduction of α,α'-dihalo ketones is a very popular method for generating symmetric oxyallyl cations. After formation of a metal enolate, dissociation of halide generates a positively charged oxyallyl intermediate. This electron-deficient 2π component reacts with electron-rich dienes to give cycloheptenones. Cyclic dienes fare better than the corresponding acyclic dienes because in order to react, the diene must be in the s-cis conformation in the presence of the short-lived oxyallyl cation—cyclic dienes are locked in this reactive conformation.
1188	Stereochemical control in the (4+3) cycloaddition is not as strict as in the Diels-Alder reaction, because the former often proceed through stepwise, polar pathways. Even when the reaction is concerted, complications may arise due to conformational dynamics in the oxyallyl component, which can exist in "W," "U," or "sickle" forms. Generally, however, the "W" form dominates. Even so, two stereochemically distinct transition states are possible: a chair-like, "extended" TS which leads to a cis relationship between the bridging atom and oxyallyl substituents, and a boat-like, "compact" TS which leads to a trans relationship.
1189	Until 2019, the asteroid's modelled orbit placed it at risk of a possible future collision with Earth in 2185. It had the third highest cumulative impact threat of all known asteroids on the Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale based on its estimated diameter of 160 meters, kinetic yield, impact probability, and time interval. Observations to 2019 have extended the observation arc by four years and detected a favourable Yarkovsky effect, which rules out impact in 2185. Using observations from 16 November 2020, the asteroid was removed from the Sentry risk table on 19 November 2020.
1190	2009 FD was initially announced as discovered on 16 March 2009 by La Sagra Sky Survey. Because there were previous observations found in images taken by the Spacewatch survey some 3 weeks prior, on 24 February 2009, the Minor Planet Center assigned the discovery credit to Spacewatch under the discovery assignment rules. 2009 FD made a close pass to Earth on 27 March 2009 at a distance of 0.004172 AU (624,100 km; 387,800 mi) and another on 24 October 2010 at 0.0702 AU. 2009 FD was recovered at apparent magnitude 23 on 30 November 2013 by Cerro Paranal Observatory, several months before the close approach of April 2014 when it passed 0.1 AU from Earth. It brightened to roughly apparent magnitude 19.3 around mid-March 2014. One radar Doppler observation of 2009 FD was made in 2014. The October–November 2015 Earth approach was studied by the Goldstone Deep Space Network.
1191	NASA's Near Earth Program originally estimated its size to be 130 metres in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.15. This gave it an estimated mass of around 2,800,000 tonnes. But work by Amy Mainzer using NEOWISE data in 2014 showed that it could be as large as 472 metres with an albedo as low as 0.01. Because 2009 FD (K09F00D) was only detected in two (W1 + W2) of the four wavelengths the suspected NEOWISE diameter is more of an upper limit. Radar observations in 2015 showed it to be a binary asteroid. The primary is 120–180 meters in diameter and the secondary is 60–120 meters in diameter.
1192	The JPL Small-Body Database shows that 2009 FD will make two very close approaches in the late 22nd century, in 2185 and 2190. As of 2016, the approach of 29 March 2185 had a 1 in 710 chance of impacting Earth. The nominal 2185 Earth approach distance was 0.009 AU (1,300,000 km; 840,000 mi). Orbit determination for 2190 is complicated by the 2185 close approach. The precise distance that it will pass from Earth and the Moon on 29 March 2185 will determine the 30 March 2190 distance. 2009 FD should pass closer to the Moon than Earth on 29 March 2185. An impact by 2009 FD would cause severe devastation to a large region or tsunamis of significant size.
1193	In January 2011, near-Earth asteroid 2009 FD (with observations through 7 December 2010) was listed on the JPL Sentry Risk Table with a 1 in 435 chance of impacting Earth on 29 March 2185. In 2014 (with observations through 5 February 2014, creating an observation arc of 1807 days) the potential 2185 impact was ruled out. Using the 2014 observations, the Yarkovsky effect has become more significant than the position uncertainties. The Yarkovsky effect has resulted in the 2185 virtual impactor returning. While 2009 FD was estimated to be 470 meters in diameter, it was rated −0.40 on the Palermo Scale, placing it higher on the Sentry Risk Table than any other known object at the time.
1194	On 14 June 2019, Alessio Del Vigna and colleagues published a new analysis, which incorporates astrometry taken in 2019. Using both JPL's Sentry as well as NEODyS's CLOMON-2 system, the new data allowed a 4-sigma detection of the Yarkovsky effect at (+3.6±0.9)×10−3 AU/Myr. The 2019 observations extended the observation arc from six years to ten years. This ruled out the 2185 impact possibility, leaving the potential impact in 2190 as the only theoretically possible impact until 2250, at a very low probability of 1 in 100 million. On 19 November 2020, the asteroid was finally completely removed from the sentry risk table as all possible impacts, including 2190 and 2250, were ruled out.
1195	2011 UL21 briefly had about a 1 in a million chance of impacting in 2029. Its cumulative impact probability dropped to 1 in 71 million by 2 November 2011 when the observation arc reached 15 days. It was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 4 November 2011 when all impact scenarios for the next 100 years or more were ruled out. During 2029, the closest approach to Earth is 1.6 AU. Palomar Observatory precovery images from 1989 and 1990 have extended the observation arc to 22 years. Its next notable close approach to the Earth will be on June 27, 2024 at a distance of 0.044 AU (6,600,000 km; 4,100,000 mi).
1196	The orbit of 1998 XX2 is well-established, and appears on the list of PHA close approaches to Earth, with the next approach at a distance of 0.020237 AU (3,027,400 km; 1,881,100 mi) on 28 November 2028. During the years 1900–2200,  close approaches are 0.017 AU (2,500,000 km; 1,600,000 mi) of the Earth (on 30 Nov 1991), as close as 0.035 AU (5,200,000 km; 3,300,000 mi) of Venus (on 28 Jan 1902 and 8 April 2039), and as close as 0.029 AU (4,300,000 km; 2,700,000 mi) of Mercury on 12 occasions. For comparison, the distance to the Moon is about 0.0026 AU (384,400 km).
1197	From 1993 to 1998, 1993 DA was the asteroid with the lowest known aphelion at 1.023 AU, and was thus the closest thing to an Apohele asteroid known at the time. When (33342) 1998 WT24 was discovered 25 November 1998, it was found to have a slightly smaller aphelion (1.019 AU) than 1993 DA, so (33342) 1998 WT24 took the title. However, (33342) 1998 WT24 lost its smallest aphelion title almost immediately when (415713) 1998 XX2 (aphelion of 1.014 AU) was discovered only a few weeks later on 8 December 1998.
1198	2010 SO16 has a horseshoe orbit that allows it to stably share Earth's orbital neighborhood without colliding with it.  It is one of a handful of known asteroids with an Earth-following orbit, a group that includes 3753 Cruithne, and the only known asteroid in an horseshoe orbit with Earth. It is, however, neither an Aten asteroid nor an Apollo asteroid because the semi-major axis of its orbit is neither less than nor greater than 1 AU, but oscillates between approximately 0.996 and 1.004 AU, with a period of about 350 years. In its ~350 yr horseshoe cycle, it never approaches Earth more closely than about 0.15 AU, alternately trailing and leading.
1199	Between 2002 and 2006, 1997 XR2 was considered to have about a 1 in 10,000 chance of colliding with Earth on 1 June 2101, based on a 27-day observation arc following its discovery. With an estimated mass of 1.7×1010 kilograms, it was ranked at level 1 on the Torino scale (0–10) of impact risk, and was the only near-Earth object to be ranked higher than zero until it was joined by 2004 VD17 at level 1 in November 2004, and then when 99942 Apophis – then known only by its provisional designation 2004 MN4 – was temporarily assessed at level four in December 2004. Both 2004 VD17 and 99942 Apophis are now rated at level zero.
1200	2004 JG6 is the second known Atira asteroid –  the first being the group's namesake 163693 Atira –  which means its entire orbit lies within that of the Earth. Its orbital period is less than that of Venus, making it one of the closest known objects to the Sun, after Mercury. Due to its eccentric orbit, it crosses the orbits of both Mercury and Venus, which also makes it a Mercury- and Venus-crosser. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0381 AU (5,700,000 km) which translates into 14.8 lunar distances.
1201	Although rather ordinary, it caused some controversy in astronomical circles due to initial projections posted on the web by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) suggesting an imminent collision with Earth on or about January 15 with a likelihood of 1:4. These projections came from very early observations, and turned out to be inaccurate (which is an ordinary occurrence in astronomy, as new observations refine the projected path of an object). In fact, the poster at the MPC had not realised that the data he had posted was essentially an impact prediction.
1202	According to the "TNOs are Cool" survey, using observations from the space-based Herschel and Spitzer telescopes, 2004 NT33 measures 423 kilometers in diameter and its surface has a visual geometric albedo of 0.125, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.10 and calculates a diameter of 482.53 kilometers with on an absolute magnitude of 4.7. Michael Brown estimates a larger diameter of 513 kilometers, based on a geometric albedo of 0.08 and an absolute magnitude of 4.9, which makes it a "highly likely dwarf planet" according to his assessment.
1203	2010 VZ98 orbits the Sun at a distance of 34.3–266.6 AU once every 1846 years (674,262 days; semi-major axis of 150.5 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.77 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. Small number statistics suggest that this body may be trapped in a 3:2 orbital resonance with an unseen planet beyond Neptune with a semi-major axis of 195–215 AU. The first precovery was taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the Apache Point Observatory in 1998, extending the body's observation arc by 12 years prior to its discovery. The precoveries were found in May 2015 (MPS 604632).
1204	Neptune has a semi-major axis of 30 AU and 1999 OX3 has a semi-major axis of 32 AU. The Minor Planet Center (MPC) does not classify this object as a centaur because the MPC defines centaurs as having a semi-major axis of less than 30.066 AU. 1999 OX3 crosses the orbits of both Neptune and Uranus and has an inclination of only 2.62°. The Deep Ecliptic Survey (DES) defines centaurs using a dynamical classification scheme, based on the behavior of orbital integrations over 10 million years. The DES defines centaurs as nonresonant objects whose osculating perihelia are less than the osculating semimajor axis of Neptune at any time during the integration. Using the dynamical definition of a centaur, 1999 OX3 is a centaur.
1205	It has an observation arc of 10 years with an uncertainty parameter of 2. Perturbations by Earth, Venus, and Mercury will increase the orbital uncertainty over time. When the asteroid only had an observation arc of 52 days, virtual clones of the asteroid that fit the uncertainty region in the known trajectory showed a 1 in 588,000 chance that the asteroid could impact Earth on 11 December 2096. With a 2096 Palermo Technical Scale of −3.42, the odds of impact by 2013 BP73 in 2096 were about 2630 times less than the background hazard level of Earth impacts which is defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. Using the nominal orbit, JPL Horizons shows that the asteroid will be 0.9 AU (130,000,000 km; 84,000,000 mi) from Earth on 11 December 2096. 2013 BP73 will make a close approach to Earth on 17 December 2018 that should allow a refinement to the known trajectory.
1206	Given its rapid rotation, it must have a density higher than 0.72 g/cm3. Stable Jacobi ellipsoids with an axis ratio of a/b ≥ 1.13±0.03, as implied by its light-curve amplitude of Δm = 0.13±0.03, exist for densities in the range of 2.29−3.00 g/cm3. The Johnston's Archive settles on 2.64 g/cm3, the centre of the latter range; for a 600 km equivalent spheroid body, this would equate to a mass of approximately 3.0×1020 kg. The relatively high estimated density (in stark contrast to many similarly sized TNOs) increases the chance that the object has no internal porosity and has collapsed into hydrostatic equilibrium (a requirement of being certified as a Dwarf Planet), but confirmation of this hypothesis requires observations to refine the size and light curve details, preferably with determination of the orbit of any satellite that may exist.
1207	When the object was first observed as 2007 EB26 by the Mount Lemmon Survey in March 2007, it was considered to have the second-smallest positive semi-major axis (0.55 AU) of any known object orbiting the Sun, after Mercury. It was classified as an Apohele asteroid, which always stay inside of Earth's orbit, approaching within 0.116 AU (17,400,000 km; 10,800,000 mi) of the Sun approximately every 148 days, before leaving for a distance of 0.98 AU, making it a Mercury- and Venus-crossing asteroid. If these early orbital calculations had not turned out to be wrong, the object would still rank today among the inner heliospheric asteroids with the smallest known perihelia.
1208	With a semi-major axis larger than that of Neptune, 2013 LU28 is generically classified as a trans-Neptunian object. It is also considered an (extended) centaur, due to its eccentric orbit with a low perihelion of 8.7 AU and a higher-than-90°-inclination, which gives it a retrograde orbit. There are only about a hundred known retrograde minor planets out of nearly 800,000 observed bodies, and, together with 2008 YB3 and 2011 MM4, it is among the largest such objects. 2013 LU28 also meets the orbital definition for being a damocloid, a cometary-like object without a coma or tail and a Tisserand's parameter with respect to Jupiter of less than 2 besides a retrograde orbit.
1209	1999 CD158 is candidate to the Haumea family, the only collisional group of trans-Neptunian objects currently determined. It is also sub-classified as a resonant trans-Neptunian object, as it stays in a 4:7 orbital resonance with the ice giant Neptune, which means, that for every seven orbits of Neptune around the Sun, it makes four orbits. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 37.4–50.1 AU once every 289 years and 8 months (105,787 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 25° with respect to the ecliptic.
1210	When first discovered, 2001 QF298 was calculated to have an absolute magnitude (H) of 4.7. Light-curve-amplitude analysis from 2008 showed only small deviations, which suggested that 2001 QF298 could be a spheroid about 480 kilometres (300 mi) in diameter with small albedo spots and hence a dwarf planet. It is not included in the same authors' list of dwarf-planet candidates from 2010 because, having an absolute magnitude of 5.4 and assumed albedo of 0.1, it would be less than the cut-off size of 450 kilometres (280 mi) (the same criteria as in the first paper).
1211	The minor planet orbits the Sun at a distance of 38.6–40.6 AU once every 249 years and 1 month (90,983 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.02 and an inclination of 18° with respect to the ecliptic.The first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory during the Digitized Sky Survey in 1984, extending the body's observation arc by 23 years prior to its discovery observation. It came to perihelion around 1888. Based on an absolute magnitude of 4.5 and assuming a generic albedo for trans-Neptunian objects of 0.09, it is about 500 kilometres (310 mi) in diameter, which makes it likely a dwarf planet.
1212	(471288) 2011 GM27 is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) in the Kuiper belt. It orbits slightly outside a 3:5 resonance with Neptune, taking 16 years (5.5% of its orbit) longer to orbit the Sun than a body in 3:5 resonance. It was discovered on 2 April 2011 at ESO's La Silla Observatory in Chile. With an absolute magnitude of 5.2, it is probably a dwarf planet, as its diameter has been roughly estimated to be about 450 kilometers based on an assumed geometric albedo of 0.06. It has a Tisserand's parameter relative to Jupiter of 5.771. Precovery observations exist dating back to 2006 in SDSS data.
1213	(471325) 2011 KT19 was discovered by the Mount Lemmon Survey on 31 May 2011. Its rediscovery was announced in August 2016 by a team of astronomers using the Pan-STARRS telescope. It was soon linked with a supposed prograde centaur (2011 KT19; inclination = 38° and semi-major axis = 28 AU) that had been lost due to a short observation arc. 2011 KT19 is in a 7:9 resonance with Neptune. Currently it is the only object with a nearly polar orbit that is in resonance with a planet. Notably, it is part of a group of objects that orbit the Sun in a highly inclined orbit; the reasons for this unusual orbit are unknown as of August 2016.
1214	The orbital characteristics of 2011 KT19 have been compared to those of 2008 KV42 (Drac). The orbits of 2011 KT19, 2008 KV42, and four other objects appear to occupy a common plane, with three in prograde and three in retrograde orbits. The probability of this alignment occurring by chance is 0.016%. These orbits should leave a common plane in a few million years because the precession of prograde and retrograde orbits are in opposite directions. Simulations including the hypothetical Planet Nine did not maintain a common orbital plane and the plane does not coincide with  the plane of the predicted high-inclination large semi-major axis objects of that model. Other simulations with a few Earth-mass dwarf planet on a high-inclination orbit also failed to reproduce the alignment.
1215	1989 TS1 is orbiting in the trailering Trojan camp, at Jupiter's L5 Lagrangian point, 60° behind the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (also see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid of the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 7 months (4,218 days; semi-major axis of 5.11 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in October 1954, or 35 years prior to its official discovery observation at Gekko.
1216	An early orbital calculation of the asteroid with an observation arc of 10 days suggested an extremely close MOID to Neptune, but further observations on March 27 refined the orbit to show that the asteroid passes no less than several astronomical units away from Neptune, and show the orbit instead being that of a typical centaur, with a perihelion near that of Saturn, and traveling near to Uranus and Neptune. Later, observations suggested a distant orbit traveling extremely distant from the Sun, but now this too has been shown to be incorrect with later observations. However, it does have a semimajor axis near that of Uranus, making it a Uranus co-orbital. However it is not a Trojan, as it stays near the opposite side of the Sun from Uranus.
1217	(474640) 2004 VN112 is a detached object (because its perihelion is greater than 40 AU). It was discovered on November 6, 2004 at Cerro Tololo. It never gets closer than 47 AU from the Sun (near the outer edge of the main Kuiper belt) and averages more than 300 AU from the Sun. Its large eccentricity strongly suggests that it was gravitationally scattered onto its current orbit. Because it is, like all detached objects, outside the current gravitational influence of Neptune, how it came to have this orbit cannot yet be explained.
1218	(474640) 2004 VN112 was discovered by the ESSENCE supernova survey on November 6, 2004 observing with the 4 m Blanco Telescope from Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Its orbit is characterized by high eccentricity (0.850), moderate inclination (25.58º) and a semi-major axis of 316 AU. Upon discovery, it was classified as a trans-Neptunian object. Its orbit is well determined; as of January 11, 2017 its orbital solution is based on 34 observations spanning a data-arc of 5821 days. (474640) 2004 VN112 has an absolute magnitude of 6.5 which gives a characteristic diameter of 130 to 300 km for an assumed albedo in the range 0.25–0.05.
1219	A companion was discovered by Denise C. Stephens and Keith S. Noll, from observations with the Hubble Space Telescope taken on 9 November 2002, and announced on 5 October 2005. The satellite, designated S/2002 (48639) 1, is relatively large, having a likely mass of about 10% of the primary. Its orbit has not been determined, but it was at a separation of only about 420 kilometres (260 mi) to the primary at the time of discovery, with a possible orbital period of about half a day and an estimated diameter of 161 kilometres (100 mi).
1220	1990 MU was first observed over three nights in 1990.  By itself, this was not enough for the asteroid to be given a permanent number since the orbit could not be calculated accurately enough for the object to be subsequently recovered.  However, the object was precovered by the Anglo-Australian Near-Earth Asteroid Survey on six photographic plates from the UK Schmidt Telescope dating back to 1974.  This technique has more success with the Amor group of asteroids which do not cross the orbit of the Earth and consequently have long periods of opposition when they can be observed.  In this respect the Apollo asteroid 1990 MU is somewhat unusual.
1221	1990 MU has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.0263 AU (3,930,000 km), which is close enough to classify it as a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (PHA). It will make a close approach to Earth on 6 June 2027 at 0.0308 AU (4,610,000 km), becoming as bright as apparent magnitude 9.7 on 8 June 2027, and even closer on 5 June 2058 at 0.0231 AU (3,460,000 km). It also made a close approach to Venus on 5 October 2012 at 0.0567 AU (8,480,000 km) and will again on 3 September 2041 at 0.0581 AU (8,690,000 km). 1990 MU has made close approaches to Earth in the past; in June 1996 it approached within 0.25 AU and in May 1990 it approached to 0.1418 AU. The Earth MOID of 1990 MU has been decreasing (becoming more hazardous) during the 20th century, while the Venus MOID (0.0455) has been increasing.
1222	The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in April 2000, nearly 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Haleakala Observatory. The discovery was announced in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular in July 2016, after additional observations by Pan-STARRS had been found (2010–2013), preceding the team's original observation from 11 January 2015, which led to the assignment of the object's first and only provisional designation, 2015 AM281. The observations were made with Pan-STARRS 1.8-meter Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, and B. Gibson, T. Goggia, N. Primak, A. Schultz, and M. Willman were the observers.
1223	According to the American astronomer Michael Brown, for an object to be considered as a "possible" dwarf planet, its diameter has to measure between 200 and 400 kilometers. With his estimated diameter of 315 kilometers, this object falls into this category, which is the one with the lowest certainty in Brown's 5-class taxonomic system used on his website. Johnston's archive estimates a diameter 336 kilometers using an albedo of 0.09. As of 2018, no spectral type and color indices, nor a rotational lightcurve have been obtained from spectroscopic and photometric observations. The body's color, rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
1224	2014 SR339 is a member of the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.90–1.70 AU once every 18 months (541 days; semi-major axis of 1.30 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.30 and an inclination of 30° with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 1.70 AU, it is also a Mars-crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.666 AU. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation by WISE in September 2014.
1225	The object belongs to the cold classical population and is a binary. The companion was discovered by Keith Noll, Will Grundy, Susan Benecchi, and Hal Levison using Hubble Space Telescope on 21 September 2008. The discovery was announced on 24 September 2009. The moon's apparent separation from the primary was 3023±93 km with an orbital period of 30.76 days. The estimated combined size of 2002 VT130 is about 324 km. The Johnston's archive estimates a mean-diameter of 251 km for the primary, and 205 km for the satellite based on a secondary-to-primary diameter ratio of 0.817.
1226	(516977) 2012 HZ84, provisional designation 2012 HZ84, is a small trans-Neptunian object from the Kuiper belt located in the outermost region of the Solar System, approximately 74 kilometers (46 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 17 April 2012, by a team of astronomers using one of the Magellan Telescopes in Chile during the New Horizons KBO Search in order to find a potential flyby target for the New Horizons spacecraft. In December 2017, this classical Kuiper belt object was imaged by the spacecraft from afar at a record distance from Earth.
1227	(523622) 2007 TG422, provisional designation 2007 TG422, is a trans-Neptunian object on a highly eccentric orbit in the scattered disc located in the outermost region of the Solar System, approximately 260 kilometers (160 miles) in diameter. It was discovered on 3 October 2007 by astronomers Andrew Becker, Andrew Puckett and Jeremy Kubica during the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico, United States. According to American astronomer Michael Brown, the bluish object is "possibly" a dwarf planet. It belongs to a group of objects studied in 2014, which lead to the proposition of the hypothetical Planet Nine.
1228	2007 TG422 is an extended scattered disc object, as its large aphelion distance is similar to that of the detached objects such as the sednoids (e.g. 90377 Sedna), its perihelion distance, however, is much lower and still just inside the gravitational influence of Neptune. The object came to perihelion in 2005 at a heliocentric distance of 35.5 AU, and is currently 37.9 AU from the Sun. It was in the constellation of Taurus until 2018, and came to opposition 29 November 2017. The body's observation arc begins at Apache Point in September 2007, one month prior to its official discovery observation. It has since been observed over a hundred times and has an orbital uncertainty of 1.
1229	Given the orbital eccentricity of this object, different epochs can generate quite different heliocentric unperturbed two-body best-fit solutions to the aphelion (maximum distance from the Sun) of this object. With a 2007 epoch the object had an approximate period of about 10,611 years with aphelion at 930 AU. But using a 2012 epoch shows a period of about 13,512 years with aphelion at 1099 AU. For objects at such high eccentricity, the Sun's barycentric coordinates are more stable than heliocentric coordinates. Using JPL Horizons with an observed orbital arc of 5 years, the barycentric orbital elements for epoch 2008-May-14 generate a semi-major axis of 503 AU and a period of 11,300 years. For comparison, Sedna has a barycentric semi-major axis of 506 AU and a period of 11,400 years. Both (308933) 2006 SQ372 and (87269) 2000 OO67 take longer than Sedna and 2007 TG422 to orbit the Sun using barycentric coordinates.
1230	Located beyond the orbit of Neptune, 2010 VK201 is a non-resonant classical Kuiper belt object (cubewano) of the so-called hot population, which have higher inclinations than those of the cold population. According to Michael Brown it is a "likely" dwarf planet. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 38.0–48.1 AU once every 282 years and 2 months (103,060 days; semi-major axis of 43.02 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 29° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Haleakala in November 2010. 2010 VK201 has been identified as a member of the Haumea family in a dynamical study led by Proudfoot and Ragozzine in 2019.
1231	2013 FZ27 is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO), located beyond the orbit of Neptune (30.1 AU). The Johnston's archive classifies it as an unspecific "other TNO", meaning that the minor planet is neither a resonant nor a classical TNO. Astronomer Michael Brown considers 2013 FZ27 to be a "likely" dwarf-planet candidate, a moderate-probability third place out of his five-level ranking system, as its estimated diameter is a little under 600 kilometers. Taking the mean of the two magnitudes, and using the standard 0.25 ~ 0.05 range for minor planets of unknown albedo, a wider 335 to 748 km spread of possibilities can be calculated for the actual diameter.
1232	The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey on 20 February 2001, over 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Cerro Tololo. The object was first announced on 2 April 2014, when American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo at the CTIO in Chile published their observations in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular. At the time the object was at 49 AU from the Sun and had an apparent magnitude of 21.1.  The Pan-STARRS-1 survey at the Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii, in the United States also found precovery observations of 2013 FZ27 after 2013 FZ27 was announced and reported them to the Minor Planet Center at a later date.
1233	According to the American astronomer Michael Brown, 2014 CQ23 measures 343 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.08. On his website, Michael Brown lists this object as a "possible" dwarf planet (200–400 km), which is the category with the lowest certainty in his 5-class taxonomic system. Similarly, Johnston's archive estimates a diameter 321 kilometers using an albedo of 0.09. As of 2018, neither a spectral type or the color indices have been determined, nor a rotational lightcurve has been obtained from spectroscopic and photometric observations. The body's color, rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
1234	According to the American astronomer Michael Brown, 2014 DF143 measures 358 kilometers in diameter based on an assumed albedo of 0.08. On his website, Michael Brown lists this object as a "possible" dwarf planet (200–400 km), which is the category with the lowest certainty in his 5-class taxonomic system. Similarly, Johnston's archive estimates a diameter 352 kilometers using an albedo of 0.09. As of 2018, no spectral type and color indices, nor a rotational lightcurve have been obtained from spectroscopic and photometric observations. The body's color, rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.
1235	(523731) 2014 OK394, also known as 1995 SN55, is a trans-Neptunian object that orbits in the outer Solar System beyond the orbit of Neptune. First observed as 1995 SN55 by Spacewatch on 20 September 1995, it was a lost minor planet with an insufficiently defined orbit with only 36 days of observations. On 8 October 2010, it was rediscovered by the Pan-STARRS 1 survey and later announced as 2014 OK394 in July 2016. It was not until November 2020 when amateur astronomers S. Deen and K. Ly identified 2014 OK394 and 1995 SN55 as the same object. This identification was confirmed and announced by the Minor Planet Center in January 2021.
1236	1995 SN55 was near perihelion 35.4 AU from the Sun when it was first observed in 1995, by astronomers Nichole Danzl and Arianna Gleason of the Spacewatch survey at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona, United States. It was only observed 14 times over 36 days, from 20 September to 26 October 1995. The discovery observations of 1995 SN55 were published and announced by the Minor Planet Center on 11 June 1999. By 2020 the 3-sigma uncertainty in the heliocentric distance to the original orbit solution for 1995 SN55 was approximately ±20 AU (3.0 billion km).
1237	2014 OK394 orbits the Sun at an average distance of 42.33 AU once every 275 years. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic plane. Over the course of its orbit, its distance from the Sun ranges from 35.4 AU at perihelion to 49.3 AU at aphelion. 2014 OK394 is in a 3:5 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune; for every three orbits it makes, Neptune orbits five times. Its orbit has a minimum orbit intersection distance approximately 5.6 AU (840 million km; 520 million mi) from Neptune's orbital path.
1238	(523764) 2014 WC510, is a binary trans-Neptunian object discovered on 8 September 2011 by the Pan-STARRS survey at the Haleakalā Observatory in Hawaii. It was found by Pan-STARRS on 20 November 2014 and was announced later in July 2016 after additional observations and precovery identifications. It is in the Kuiper belt, a region of icy objects orbiting beyond Neptune in the outer Solar System. It is classified as a plutino, a dynamical class of objects in a 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune. On 1 December 2018, a team of astronomers observed a stellar occultation by the object, which revealed that it is a compact binary system consisting of two separate components in close orbit around each other. The primary and secondary components are estimated to have diameters of around 180 km (110 mi) and 140 km (87 mi), respectively.
1239	Before the announcement of its discovery, 2014 WC510 had been observed by the Pan-STARRS survey from 2011 to 2015. All of these observations were made with the Pan-STARRS 1 1.8-meter Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, located at the Haleakalā Observatory atop the Hawaiian island of Maui. The accredited observers using the telescope were B. Gibson, T. Goggia, N. Primak, A. Schultz, and M. Willman. The object was first identified on 20 November 2014, though it was announced later in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular published on 17 July 2016, after additional observations by Pan-STARRS had been found, preceding the team's original observation from 2014. While 2014 WC510 is the object's first and only provisional designation assigned by the Minor Planet Center, the date of discovery is considered to be on 8 September 2011, which was the earliest known observation of the object before it was assigned a minor planet number.
1240	On 1 December 2018, 2014 WC510 occulted a 15th-magnitude double star, blocking out its starlight for a maximal duration of approximately 11 seconds. The stellar occultation was observed by astronomers and citizen scientists across the West Coast of the United States and Canada. Of the 41 participating sites, six of them reported dimmings in the star's brightness, signifying likely positive detections of the occultation. Five of these sites reported two consecutive dimmings due to the occulted star's double nature; 2014 WC510 occulted one of the two stars being observed. These observations were part of a campaign coordinated by the Research and Education Collaborative Occultation Network (RECON), a citizen science project dedicated to observing occultations by trans-Neptunian objects.
1241	Prior to the occultation, 2014 WC510 had only been observed by Pan-STARRS over an observation arc of 3 years. The calculated orbit from these Pan-STARRS observations had significant uncertainty, which would have been unreliable for predicting occultations. In an effort to reduce the orbital uncertainty, the RECON project collaborated with the Pan-STARRS project to do a precovery search of archival Pan-STARRS images to gather extensive astrometric positions of 2014 WC510. Follow-up observations by Pan-STARRS were also conducted through 2016–2018 and helped extend 2014 WC510's observation arc to 6.3 years. Although an observation arc of this length is generally unreliable for predicting occultations especially by distant objects, this was compensated by Pan-STARRS's highly accurate astrometric system, allowing for 2014 WC510's orbital uncertainty to be significantly reduced.
1242	Observations of the December 2018 occultation revealed that 2014 WC510 is a compact binary system consisting of two separate components in close orbit around each other. Of the six sites that reported positive detections of the occultation, one site located in Bishop, California, detected a shorter dimming event separate from the main detections by the other five sites located south of it. A 2020 study led by Rodrigo Leiva and Marc Buie analyzed the occultation data and determined that the detection from Bishop was most likely an occultation by a secondary component of 2014 WC510.
1243	Since the two components were only observed for a short period of time during the occultation, the binary system's orbital parameters have not been determined. The projected separation distance between the primary and secondary is 349 ± 29 km (217 ± 18 mi), derived from an angular separation of 16±1 milliarcseconds. Assuming a density of 1 g/cm3 for both components, their mutual orbital period would likely be under one day. 2014 WC510 has the smallest observed component separation of all known binary TNOs as of 2020, followed by (48639) 1995 TL8 (~420 km) and 47171 Lempo (~870 km). Such close binary TNOs would be difficult to resolve in direct imaging due to their characteristic small separation distances between their components.
1244	Assuming a circular projected shape for the components' occultation profiles, the diameters of the primary and secondary are estimated to be 181 ± 16 km (112.5 ± 9.9 mi) and 138 ± 32 km (86 ± 20 mi), respectively. The diameter ratio of the secondary to the primary is 0.76:1.00—the secondary component is approximately 75% as large as the primary. Since the mutual orbit of the components is undetermined, the mass and density of the 2014 WC510 system cannot be derived. The individual components of the 2014 WC510 system are among the smallest trans-Neptunian objects with sizes measured with stellar occultations, following the Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth (~30 km).
1245	2014 WC510 is classified as a plutino, a subgroup of the resonant trans-Neptunian objects located in the inner region of Kuiper belt. Named after the group's largest member, Pluto, the plutinos are in a 2:3 mean-motion orbital resonance with Neptune. That is, they complete two orbits around the Sun for every three orbits that Neptune takes. 2014 WC510 orbits the Sun at an average distance of 39.24 astronomical units (5.87×109 km; 3.65×109 mi), taking 245.8 years to complete a full orbit. This is characteristic of all plutinos, which have orbital periods around 250 years and semi-major axes around 39 AU.
1246	Like Pluto, 2014 WC510's orbit is elongated and inclined to the ecliptic. 2014 WC510 has an orbital eccentricity of 0.25 and an orbital inclination of 19.5 degrees with respect to the ecliptic. Over the course of its orbit, 2014 WC510's distance from the Sun varies from 29.5 AU at perihelion (closest distance) to 48.9 AU at aphelion (farthest distance). 2014 WC510 has last passed aphelion in the early 20th century, and is now moving closer to the Sun, approaching perihelion by 2032. Simulations by the Deep Ecliptic Survey show that 2014 WC510 can acquire a perihelion distance (qmin) as small as 28.7 AU over the next 10 million years.
1247	(523775) 2014 YB35, provisional designation 2014 YB35, is a stony near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately 300 meters (980 feet) in diameter. It was discovered on 27 December 2014 by the Catalina Sky Survey at the Catalina Station in Arizona, United States. In March 2015, a minor-planet moon, less than half the size of its primary, was discovered by radar astronomers at Goldstone Observatory. The primary body of the binary system has a rotation period of 3.3 hours, while the secondary's orbital period remains unknown.
1248	(523794) 2015 RR245, provisional designation 2015 RR245, is a large trans-Neptunian object of the Kuiper belt in the outermost regions of the Solar System. It was discovered on 9 September 2015, by the Outer Solar System Origins Survey at Mauna Kea Observatories on the Big island of Hawaii, in the United States. The object is in a rare 2:9 resonance with Neptune and measures approximately 600 kilometers in diameter. 2015 RR245 may have a satellite according to a study announced by Noyelles et al. in a European Planetary Science Congress meeting in 2019.
1249	Additional precovery astrometry from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Pan-STARRS1 survey shows that 2015 RR245 is a resonant trans-Neptunian object, securely trapped in a 2:9 mean motion resonance with Neptune, meaning that this minor planet orbits the Sun twice in the same amount of time it takes Neptune to complete 9 orbits. The object is unlikely to have been trapped in the 2:9 resonance for the age of Solar System. It is much more likely that it has been hopping between various resonances and got trapped in the 2:9 resonance in the last 100 million years.
1250	Its exact size is uncertain, but the best estimate is around 670 km (420 mi) in diameter, assuming an albedo of 0.12 (within a wider range of 500 to 870 km, based on albedos of 0.21 to 0.07). For comparison, Pluto, the largest object in the Kuiper belt, is about 2,374 km (1,475 mi) in diameter. Astronomer Michael Brown assumes an albedo of 0.11 and calculates a diameter of 626 km, while the Johnston's Archive gives a diameter of 770 kilometers, based on an assumed albedo of 0.09.All of these estimates assume that 2015 RR245 is a single object, the discovery of a large satellite means that the size is likely to be smaller.
1251	1999 CW8 is an Apollo asteroid that crosses Earth's orbit. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.9–3.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,221 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.60 and an inclination of 34° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid never approaches Earth closer than 0.2 AU in the foreseeable future, but occasionally makes close approaches to Mars of 0.07 AU. It makes one such approach in 2073, at 0.067 AU, and another one in 2103, at 0.094 AU. Due to 1999 CW8's relatively high inclination, although it passes closer to the Sun than the Earth (0.9 AU), it never comes closer than 0.2 AU.
1252	It is a carbonaceous B-type asteroid, relatively rare in the asteroid belt but common in the inner Solar System. Based on an absolute magnitude of 18.6, and an assumed albedo of 0.159 (derived from the B-type asteroid 2 Pallas), the asteroid can be estimated to have a mean-diameter of approximately 640 meters. If it impacted the Earth would cause significant damage, but not as much as the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event progenitor, which brought about a mass extinction, as it is only 1/20 to 1/10 the size. However, it is unlikely to come close enough to Earth to impact it, or even become a risk of impact.
1253	2002 CY248 orbits the Sun at a distance of 39.4–53.1 AU once every 314 years and 6 months (114,859 days; semi-major axis of 46.2 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Kitt Peak with its official first observation on 6 February 2002. A 10-million-year integration of the orbit shows that it is a Classical Kuiper belt object that does not get closer to the Sun than 38.8 AU (5.80 billion km) or further than 54 AU.
1254	It was discovered on 11 November 2002 at Lowell Observatory. As of February 2013, 2002 VE68 has been observed telescopically 457 times with a data-arc span of 2,947 days and it was the target of Doppler observations in 5 occasions; therefore, its orbit is very well determined. Its semi-major axis of 0.7237 AU is very similar to that of Venus but its eccentricity is rather large (0.4104) and its orbital inclination is also significant (9.0060°). The spectrum of 2002 VE68 implies that it is an X-type asteroid and hence an albedo of about 0.25 should be assumed. The body is calculated to measure 236 meters in diameters. Its rotational period is 13.5 hours and its light curve has an amplitude of 0.9 mag which hints at a very elongated body, perhaps a contact binary.
1255	The existence of retrograde satellites or quasi-satellites was first considered by J. Jackson in 1913 but none was discovered until almost 100 years later. 2002 VE68 was the first quasi-satellite to be discovered, in 2002, although it was not immediately recognized as such. 2002 VE68 was identified as a quasi-satellite of Venus by Seppo Mikkola, Ramon Brasser, Paul A. Wiegert and Kimmo Innanen in 2004, two years after the actual discovery of the object. From the perspective of a hypothetical observer in a frame of reference rotating with Venus, it appears to travel around the planet during one Venusian year although it does not orbit Venus but the Sun like any other asteroid. As quasi-satellite, this minor body is trapped in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance with Venus. Besides being a Venus co-orbital, this Aten asteroid is also a Mercury grazer and an Earth crosser. 2002 VE68 exhibits resonant (or near-resonant) behavior with Mercury, Venus and Earth. It seems to have been co-orbital with Venus for only the last 7,000 years, and is destined to be ejected from this orbital arrangement about 500 years from now. During this time, its distance to Venus has been and will remain larger than about 0.2 AU (3·107 km).
1256	2002 VE68 is included in the Minor Planet Center list of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs) because it comes relatively frequently to within 0.05 AU of Earth. Approaches as close as 0.04 AU occur with a periodicity of 8 years due to its near 8:13 resonance with Earth. 2002 VE68 was discovered during the close approaches of 11 November 2002. During the last close encounter on 7 November 2010, 2002 VE68 approached Earth within 0.035 AU (13.6 Lunar distances), brightening below 15th magnitude. Its next fly-by with Earth happened on 4 November 2018 at 0.038 AU (5,700,000 km; 3,500,000 mi). Numerical simulations indicate that an actual collision with Earth during the next 10,000 years is not likely, although dangerously close approaches to about 0.002 AU are possible, a distance potentially within Earth's Hill sphere.
1257	1989 AU1 is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8–5.6 AU once every 11 years and 9 months (4,303 days; semi-major axis of 5.18 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Gekko Observatory in January 1989.
1258	1989 AU1 is the member of the small Eurybates family (005), named after its parent body, 3548 Eurybates. This asteroid family comprises 218 known members of carbonaceous and/or primitive composition, and is one of only a few families identified among the Jovian asteroids; with four of them in the Greek camp. This potentially collisional family was first characterized by Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Brož in 2011, and further described in 2014. Other members of this family include the Jupiter trojans 8060 Anius, 9818 Eurymachos, (163189) 2002 EU6, (287577) 2003 FE42 and 360072 Alcimedon. In the HCM analysis by Milani and Knežević, however, 1989 AU1 belongs to the background population.
1259	(52768) 1998 OR2 (provisional designation 1998 OR2) is an asteroid on an eccentric orbit, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Amor group, with a diameter of 2 kilometers (1.2 mi). It was discovered on 24 July 1998, by astronomers of the Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking (NEAT) program at the Haleakala Observatory, Hawaii. It is one of the brightest and therefore largest potentially hazardous asteroids known to exist. With an observation arc of 32 years, the asteroid has a well-determined orbit, and its trajectory is well known through the year 2197. The asteroid's orbit is only potentially hazardous on a time scale of thousands of years.
1260	With an absolute magnitude of approximately 15.8, 1998 OR2 is one of the brightest and presumably largest-known potentially hazardous asteroids (see PHA-list). It currently has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of 0.0154 AU (2,300,000 km), which translates into 6.0 lunar distances (LD). On 16 April 2079, this asteroid will make a near-Earth encounter at a safe distance of 0.0118 AU (4.59 LD), and pass the Moon at 0.0092 AU (3.6 LD). The asteroid's orbit is only potentially hazardous on a time scale of hundreds, if not thousands, of years.
1261	(528219) 2008 KV42 (provisionally designated 2008 KV42, and nicknamed Drac) is a trans-Neptunian object (TNO) and the first one with a retrograde orbit to be discovered. This retrograde motion with an orbital inclination of 103° suggests that it is the missing link between its source in the Hills cloud and Halley-type comets, thus providing further insight into the evolution of the outer Solar System. The object measures no more than 90 kilometers (56 miles) across. With a semi-major axis of 42 AU, it takes about 269 years to complete an orbit around the Sun.
1262	The discovery of 2008 KV42 was announced on 16 July 2008 by the Canada–France Ecliptic Plane Survey team led by Brett Gladman from the University of British Columbia. The announcement was made during the "Asteroids, Comets, Meteors" meeting held in Baltimore, Maryland, followed by a Minor Planet Electronic Circular on the same day and an IAU Circular on 18 July. The discovery was made using images obtained on 31 May from the 3.5 meter Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, followed by further observations until 8 July from the Whipple Observatory and Cerro Tololo.
1263	Based on an absolute magnitude of 4.4, 2008 ST291 is estimated by the Johnston's Archive to be about 584 kilometres (363 mi) in diameter, assuming a typical albedo of 0.09 for trans-Neptunian objects. Astronomer Mike Brown estimates a slightly smaller 549 km from the same albedo and a fainter 4.6 magnitude. The Asteroid Dynamic Site records a brighter 4.3 magnitude, which calculates to 612 km using the same albedo (and same formula as Johnston's); using the average of these magnitudes and a standard assumed minor planet albedo range of 0.25 ~ 0.05, possible sizes of 345 to 773 km are produced.
1264	Using Hubble Space Telescope observations taken in January 2018, Scott Sheppard found a satellite around 2013 FY27, 0.17 arcseconds away and 3.0±0.2 mag fainter than the primary. The discovery was announced on 10 August 2018. Assuming the two components have equal albedos, they are about 740 kilometres (460 mi) and 190 kilometres (120 mi) in size, respectively. Follow up observations were taken between May and July 2018 in order to determine the orbit of the satellite, but the results of those observations have not yet been released. Once the orbit is known, the masses and densities of the two components can be determined.
1265	During the observations in January 1997, it was also revealed that 1992 AX is a synchronous binary asteroid with a minor-planet moon in its orbit. The satellite measures approximately 780 meters in diameter, or about 20% of its primary, and has an orbital period of 13.52 hours with an estimated semi-major axis of 5.8 kilometers for its very circular orbit. Observations by Pravec in January and February 2012 confirmed the binary nature of this asteroid, as well as its rotational and orbital periods. The satellite's provisional designation is S/1997 (5407) 1.
1266	Using an absolute magnitude of 4.3 from the Asteroids—Dynamic Site, and assuming an albedo in the range of 0.05 to 0.25, the object's mean-diameter may be as low as 370, and as high as 820 kilometers. Johnstons's Archive assumes a similar albedo of 0.9 and calculates a diameter of 671 kilometers using an absolute magnitude of 4.1. American astronomer Michael Brown estimates a diameter of 583 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 4.4 and an assumed albedo of 0.10. According to Brown, a diameter of 600 km would give 2014 AN55 a highly likely dwarf-planet status.
1267	(55565) 2002 AW197 is a classical, non-resonant trans-Neptunian object from the Kuiper belt in the outermost region of the Solar System, also known as cubewano. With a diameter of at least 700 kilometers (430 miles), Brown considers it a highly likely dwarf planet candidate. Tancredi notes that photometric observations suggest that it is a spheroid with a high albedo and small albedo spots. However, its low albedo suggests it does not have planetary geology. It is approximately tied (to within measurement uncertainties) as the largest unnamed object in the Solar System and the largest planetoid without a moon. It was discovered at Palomar Observatory in 2002 and has a rotation period of 8.8 hours and a moderately red color.
1268	In 2004, the non-detection of IR thermal emissions put an upper limit of 709 kilometres (441 mi) on its diameter and a lower limit on the albedo of 0.19. In a 2006 International Astronomical Union press release discussing the IAU 2006 draft proposal, a diagram suggested that 2002 TX300 could be as large as 50000 Quaoar. The artist's diagram was largely based on the concept that 2002 TX300, with an absolute magnitude (H) of 3.4, may have an albedo around 0.08, which resulted in an overly optimistic diameter estimate of around 1,000 kilometres (620 mi).
1269	The spectrum in the visible and near-infrared rages is very similar to that of Charon, characterized by neutral to blue slope (1%/1000 Å) with deep (60%) water absorption bands at 1.5 and 2.0 μm. Mineralogical analysis indicates a substantial fraction of large ice (H2O) particles. The signal-to-noise ratio of the observations was insufficient to differentiate between amorphous or crystalline ice (crystalline ice was reported on Charon, Quaoar and Haumea). The proportion of highly processed organic materials (tholins), typically present on numerous trans-Neptunian objects, is very low. As suggested by Licandro et al. 2006, this lack of irradiated mantle suggest either a recent collision or comet activity.
1270	The analysis of combined thermal radiometry of 2002 UX25 from measurements by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Telescope indicates an effective diameter of 692 ± 23 km and albedo of 0.107+0.005−0.008. Assuming equal albedos for the primary and secondary it leads to the size estimates of ~664 km and ~190 km, respectively. If the albedo of the secondary is half of that of the primary the estimates become ~640 and ~260 km, respectively. Using an improved thermophysical model slightly different sizes were obtained for UX25 and its satellite: 659 km and 230 km, respectively.
1271	With a density of 0.82 g/cm3, assuming that the primary and satellite have the same density, 2002 UX25 is one of the largest known solid objects in the Solar System that is less dense than water. Why this should be is not well understood, because objects of its size in the Kuiper belt often contain a fair amount of rock and are hence pretty dense. To have a similar composition to others large KBOs, it would have to be exceptionally porous, which was believed to be unlikely given the compactability of water ice; this low density thus astonished astronomers. Studies by Grundy et al. suggest that at the low temperatures that prevail beyond Neptune, ice is brittle and can support significant porosity in objects significantly larger than 2002 UX25, particularly if rock is present; the low density could thus be a consequence of this object failing to warm sufficiently during its formation to significantly deform the ice and fill these pore spaces. 
1272	The near-infrared spectrum of 2002 VE95 is flat with two distinct absorption bands of water ice at 1.5 and 2.0 μm. There is the third feature near 2.3 μm of unclear origin. The spectral behavior of this object is similar to 5145 Pholus, a centaur. The surface of 2002 VE95 is heterogeneous—the amount of different ices and non-ice components depends on the observed area. Among the probable surface materials are water ice, methanol ice and various titan/triton tholins. The methanol ice is generally associated with redder areas. The surface of 2002 VE95 appears to be primordial in origin.
1273	The stony S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.1–3.7 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,392 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.54 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. It has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of nearly 0.184 AU (27,500,000 km), which corresponds to 71.8 lunar distances. As it crosses the orbit of Mars, it may also be classified as a Mars-crosser, and, on 28 November 2023, it will pass 0.02535 AU (3,792,000 km) from the Red Planet. The first precovery was taken at the Australian Siding Spring Observatory in 1981, extending the body's observation arc by 12 years prior to its discovery.
1274	As an eccentric Amor asteroid has an Earth minimum orbit intersection distance of 0.1922 AU (28,800,000 km) and approaches the orbit of Earth from the outside but does not cross it. It crosses however the orbit of Mars and can be classified as a Mars-crosser and also approaches the orbit of Jupiter within 0.5 AU. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.2–4.5 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,732 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The first precovery was taken at Siding Spring Observatory in 1977, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 9 years prior to its discovery.
1275	The asteroid achieved its most notable recognition when scientists revealed that it contained over "10,000 tons of gold and 100,000 tons of platinum", or an approximate value at the time of its discovery of "$90 billion for the gold and a cool trillion dollars for the platinum, plus loose change for the asteroid's 10 billion tons of iron and a billion tons of nickel." In 2012 the estimated value of 100,000 tons of platinum was worth approximately five trillion US dollars. The delta-v for a spacecraft rendezvous with this asteroid from low earth orbit is 7.1 km/s.
1276	It orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.7–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 2 months (1,164 days; semi-major axis of 2.17 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first observed as 1953 RK1 at the former Alma-Ata Observatory (210) in September 1953. The body's observation arc begins with its observation as 1979 YG9 at Crimea–Nauchnij in December 1979, or almost 6 years prior to its official discovery observation at Palomar Observatory.
1277	According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), 1985 TW3 measures between 4.95 and 5.20 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.285 and 0.287. The Johnston's archive derives a diameter of 4.81 km and 1.16 km for the primary and secondary, respectively, based on an effective WISE-diameter of 4.95 km and using the lower limit of 0.24 for the secondary-to-primary diameter-ratio (Ds/p) determined by David Higgins. Later observation by Higgins and Pravec determined a Ds/p ratio of 0.30 to 0.32, which increases the satellites size by a quarter to a third if all other factors remain unchanged. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for members of the Flora family of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 5.17 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 13.6.
1278	The presumed E-type asteroid may not be a member of the Hungaria family, which form the innermost dense concentration of asteroids in the Solar System, but an unrelated interloper, which intruded into the Hungaria orbital space, as indicated by a lower albedos from observations by the NEOWISE mission. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.7–1.9 AU once every 2 years and 6 months (900 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's first yet unused observation was made at the Chinese Purple Mountain Observatory in 1983. On 13 April 2042 and on 3 October 2113, the asteroid will pass 0.086 AU (12,900,000 km) and 0.092 AU (13,800,000 km) from Mars, respectively.
1279	The S-type body is an Amor asteroid – a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.0–4.0 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,444 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.59 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. Its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with Earth is 0.0420 AU, and on 1 August 2086, it will make a close approach and pass by Earth at a distance of 0.09 AU (13,000,000 km).
1280	1986 TR6 is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 8 months (4,265 days; semi-major axis of 5.15 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Piwnice in October 1986.
1281	The dark C-type asteroid is a member of the Themis family, a dynamical family of outer-belt asteroids with nearly coplanar ecliptical orbits. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.8–3.4 AU once every 5 years and 5 months (1,987 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 1° with respect to the ecliptic. It was first identified as 1933 FU at Heidelberg in 1933, extending the body's observation arc by 60 years prior to its official discovery observation at La Silla.
1282	(7474) 1992 TC is a large sized M-type asteroid discovered by Robert H. McNaught in 1992.  It is notably one of a few similar M-type asteroids, including the named asteroids 4660 Nereus and 65803 Didymos, which can be reached easily by spacecraft from Earth.  The delta-V required to reach 7474 (1992 TC) would be about 5.6 kilometres per second (3.5 mi/s), which is less than is needed to reach the moon. M-type asteroids are thought to be composed primarily of nickel and iron, which if proven to be true means that 7474 (1992 TC) may one day become an important source of raw materials in space.
1283	1992 TB makes close approaches to Earth, but often comes many times closer to Venus. Soon after the discovery of the asteroid in 1992, a close approaches of Earth was made. Three years after it was discovered, 1992 TB came 45,720,000 km (0.3056 AU) from Earth. In 2003, (8035) 1992 TB was listed as a potentially hazardous object, but has since been removed. However, 1992 TB is not expected to come within 37,000,000 km (0.25 AU) of Earth in the near future. On the other hand, 1992 TB can come much closer to Venus. Its next Venus encounter was in 29 May 2015, where it came 11,710,000 km (0.0783 AU) from the planet. Its closest approach in the near future will be 7,380,000 km (0.0493 AU).
1284	According to astronomer Michael Brown and based on radiometric observations, 2001 FP185 measures 336 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an (assumed) albedo of 0.05. Observations with the PACS-instrument of the Herschel Space Observatory during a survey of scattered-disc objects ("TNO are cool") found a similar diameter of 332 kilometer with an albedo of 0.046. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a higher albedo of 0.10 and consequently derives a much shorter diameter of 222 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 6.38. Brown considers 2001 FP185 to be possibly a dwarf planet (see list).
1285	2002 TC302 has an absolute magnitude (H) of 3.78. It has an estimated diameter of 584.1+105.6−88.0 km. Using the Spitzer Space Telescope, it was previously estimated to have a diameter of 1145+337−325 km, which would have made it one of the largest possible dwarf planets. This overestimation was due to insufficient motion to allow for a good sky subtraction and because it was very close to a brighter background object. Brown noted that the Spitzer measurement involved a very large potential error and that the object would likely be smaller, making its chances of it being a dwarf planet "likely" rather than "near certainty", in his opinion.
1286	The mean diameter of 2002 TC302 determined from occultations in 2018 is smaller than the larger diameter estimate of 584.1+105.6−88.0 km by Spitzer in 2008. Despite the large uncertainty in the Spitzer's estimate, the difference of ~84 km between the two diameters is significant, implying that 2002 TC302 may have a large satellite with a possible size range of 100–300 km, nearly as large as 2002 TC302 itself. This possible satellite is expected to orbit 2002 TC302 at a very close distance of less than 2000 km, close enough to slow down 2002 TC302's rotation through tidal interactions.
1287	If both the primary body and satellite are doubly tidally locked, then the expected orbital period of the satellite would be approximately 54 hours, equal to 2002 TC302's rotaton. Given an orbital period of 54 hours, the satellite's estimated orbital separation from the primary would be 1780 km, with an angular separation of 58 milliarcseconds, too small to be resolved with current space telescopes such as Hubble. Under the assumption the satellite's diameter is 200 km, it would cause 2002 TC302's position to oscillate by 18 milliarcseconds as it orbits around its barycenter.
1288	In 2007, its diameter was initially estimated by the Spitzer Space Telescope at 725±200 km. However, in 2012, this was reduced to 523.0+35.1−34.4 km after new Herschel Space Telescope observations. In 2019, 2003 VS2 was found to be ellipsoidal in shape based on stellar occultations that occurred in 2013 and 2014; the light curve derived from the occultations suggests that this plutino is not in hydrostatic equilibrium and hence not a dwarf planet. The dimensions of 2003 VS2 are estimated at 627.6 km × 531 km × 494.6 km, with a volume-equivalent diameter 548.3+29.5−44.6 km. 2003 VS2 has no known satellite that can be used to directly determine its mass, but assuming a density of 1 g/cm3, typical of mid size TNO's, gives a mass estimate of about 7.5×1019 kg.
1289	With an orbital period of 364.3 days, 1998 UP1 is in a near 1:1 orbital resonance with Earth. Although their periods are almost identical, their orbits are very different; 1998 UP1 has a highly eccentric orbit and moves between 0.65–1.35 AU from the Sun, it is also very highly inclined at 33°. The preliminary period of 1998 UP1 was originally thought to be slightly longer than 1 year producing an error in the predicted position of about 35 degrees; it was selected as a priority for recovery and recovered by the Camarillo Observatory on 12 October 1999.
1290	(85989) 1999 JD6 is an Aten asteroid, near-Earth object, and potentially hazardous object in the inner Solar System that makes frequent close approaches to Earth and Venus. On the Earth approach in 2015, it was observed by the Goldstone Solar System Radar and found to be a contact binary with the largest axis approximately 2 kilometers wide, and each lobe about 200–300 meters large. Although 1999 JD6 in its current orbit never passes closer than 0.047 AU to Earth, it is listed as a potentially hazardous object because it is large and might pose a threat in the future.
1291	Binzel et al. (2001) have found that 1999 JV6 has a spectral class of an Xk-type asteroid. Thermal infrared observations using the WISE spacecraft by Mainzer et al. (2011) and the Spitzer Space Telescope by Mueller et al. (2011) give a diameter of 0.45 km (0.28 mi). Warner et al. (2014, 2015) suggest that 1999 JV6 has a highly elongated shape due to its large light curve amplitude of 0.9 magnitudes. Based on 1999 JV6's large brightness changes, they measured a rotation period of 6.54 hours. In January 2015, radar imaging by the Arecibo Observatory and the Green Bank Observatory confirmed 1999 JV6's elongated shape and provided delay-Doppler images used to obtain a preliminary estimate of a 3D model for its shape. The radar data reveal an apparent concavity and suggest that 1999 JV6 is a contact binary.
1292	1999 NC43 has a well-determined orbit with an uncertainty of 0. The body orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.7–2.8 AU once every 2 years and 4 months (852 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.58 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. Its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance is 0.0243 AU (3,640,000 km), which corresponds to 9.5 lunar distances. Its most notable close approach to Earth will be on 14 February 2173 at a distance of 0.03361 AU (5,028,000 km). The asteroid also makes close approaches to Venus and Mars.
1293	Several rotational lightcurves were obtained from photometric observations by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec at Ondřejov Observatory and American astronomer Brian Warner at his private Palmer Divide Observatory, Colorado. Best rated results gave a rotation period of 34.49±0.18 hours with an exceptionally high brightness variation of 1.1 magnitude (U=n.a.). Pravec's alternative period of 122 hours was later not supported by Warner. However, there are still other periods possible due to sparse photometric data points. The asteroid is also suspected to be in a tumbling motion, which makes the determination of its period more complex. For an asteroid of its size, it is a relatively slow rotator.
1294	2002 NT7 was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 1 August 2002, (23 days after discovery) so there is no risk of an impact by it in the next 100 years. On 13 January 2019, the asteroid safely passed 0.4078 AU (61,010,000 km; 37,910,000 mi) from Earth with a 3-sigma uncertainty region of about ±108 km. Between 1900 and 2195 the closest approach to Earth will occur on 15 January 2099 at a distance of roughly 0.3739 AU (55,930,000 km; 34,760,000 mi) with uncertainty region of about ±430 km.
1295	1996 RJ is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's L4 Lagrangian point, 60° ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.9–5.4 AU once every 11 years and 10 months (4,320 days; semi-major axis of 5.19 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.05 and an inclination of 31° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins in December 1986, with its first observation as 1986 XP5 at the Observatory of the University of St Andrews (482), Scotland, almost 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Catalina Station.
1296	This asteroid orbits the Sun with a short orbital period at a distance of 0.3–1.2 AU once every 227 days. The body rotates every two and a half hours around its axis and has a notably high albedo of about 0.40. Its orbit is tilted by 29 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. With an exceptionally high eccentricity of 0.59, it was the most eccentric Aten asteroid known at the time of discovery, more eccentric than previously discovered Aten, 3753 Cruithne. Since then, more eccentric Atens – such as (162004) 1991 VE, with an eccentricity of 0.665 – have been discovered. Due to this elongated orbit, the Aten asteroid and near-Earth asteroid also classifies as Earth-crosser, Venus-crosser and Mercury-grazer.
1297	Being so close to Venus, it is also the first asteroid discovered within Venus' zone of influence. This means that it is close enough to Venus for the planet to capture 1989 VA into a co-orbital relationship. Though it is not a Venus co-orbital at the moment, it may become one in the future and may have been one in the past. Currently, the only known Venus co-orbitals are 2001 CK32, 2002 VE68 and 2012 XE133 (as of 18 March 2013). Of the seven known objects in Venus' zone of influence, 1989 VA is the largest at about 1,400 metres. All of these objects, like 1989 VA, have eccentric orbits that cross Mercury's and Earth's orbits as well.
1298	The combination of a small semi-major axis and high eccentricity made 1989 VA the first Aten asteroid discovered to get closer to the Sun (0.295 AU) than Mercury ever does. 2340 Hathor (the second Aten discovered, in 1976) had the smallest perihelion (0.464 AU) earlier, which was about the same distance as Mercury's aphelion (0.467 AU). It was not until (66063) 1998 RO1 (0.277 AU) was discovered that an Aten asteroid with a lower perihelion was found. 1989 VA's eccentric orbit takes it out past the Earth, where it has encounters of about 0.15 to 0.20 AU about every 3 to 5 years around October–November. It was discovered during its 1989 encounter and was about 0.17 AU away at the time. Further observations were made in October 2002 and during the most recent close encounter in November 2007.
1299	When it became obvious we wouldn't be working with Kevin again, me and Dale were very discouraged fellows – I was bummed out for 18 months! We didn't know what we were going to do, but we knew we were going to do something. We'd played with Big Business and Jared [Warren]'s name had been batted around when we were thinking of bass players but I thought instead of just getting him, why don't we just get both those guys? We thought about two drummers a long time ago and messed around a little bit but [getting Coady Willis, Big Business' drummer] was the best decision we could have made. I'm not afraid of making changes and everything's worked out perfectly for everybody including Kevin. This record is one of my favourites and I think we're just scratching the surface of what we can do with these guys.
1300	"(Ain't Nobody Loves You) Like I Do" is a 1987 single by American singer La Toya Jackson. The song is taken from her fifth album, La Toya. It is one of only four songs by Jackson to have an accompanying music video. The song features a bridge sung by Mike Stock. The single was released in 1987 throughout Europe, excluding the United Kingdom. Despite being produced by the European trio Stock Aitken Waterman, who were big hit-producers at the time, the single failed to chart. The B-side of the single, "(Tell Me) She Means Nothing To You At All", was released as its own single in France. The 12" singles include a longer version of the song.
1301	However, the single did fairly well on the German DJ charts. It debuted at No. 17 and stayed on the charts for several months. She also performed the song on the German television show Die Verflixte Sieben (with Rudi Carrell). The music video for the single was given little airplay and was never released on video or DVD. It didn't surface on the internet until March 2007. The Miami News described the number as "so unlike anything Stock Aitken and Waterman have produced that it seems a mistake to see their names on the credits. 'Like I Do' is funky, gritty and doesn't repeat every other verse 25 times."
1302	The November 2016 MailOnline article is about the inferred family background of American actress Meghan Markle (born 1981) and her upbringing in the Los Angeles district of Crenshaw with her mother, Doria Ragland. It was published after Markle began dating Prince Harry. The full headline is "Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton: Gang-scarred home of her mother revealed – so will he be dropping by for tea?". It was also published on 2 November 2016 in a byline given to Ruth Styles "in Los Angeles for Dailymail.com". Crenshaw is portrayed in the article as having a high crime rate with the first paragraph stating that "Plagued by crime and riddled with street gangs, the troubled Los Angeles neighborhood that Doria Ragland, 60, calls home couldn't be more different to London's leafy Kensington. But social worker Ragland might now find herself welcoming a royal guest to downtrodden Crenshaw after Prince Harry was revealed to be dating her daughter – Suits actress Meghan Markle".
1303	In reaction to the March 2021 Oprah with Meghan and Harry television interview with Oprah Winfrey, Finlay Greig wrote in the Edinburgh Evening News that the headline insinuates that Meghan comes from a "life of crime", despite being brought up in a middle class area, which had suffered significant damage from both the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1994 Northridge earthquake, but was able to rebound in the late 2000s with the help of redevelopment and gentrification. The 2016 "(Almost) Straight Outta Compton" article also captioned a picture: "Prince Harry's new girl, Meghan Markle, grew up in this house in Crenshaw, Los Angeles, a troubled area that had 47 crimes in the past week – including murder."
1304	The tone of this and other articles prompted Prince Harry's Communications Secretary to issue a statement that deplored the "racist" and "sexist" commentary and coverage received by Meghan. The statement described Meghan as having been "...subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Some of this has been very public — the smear on the front page of a national newspaper; the racial undertones of comment pieces; and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments". The statement described Harry as worried about Meghan's safety and concluded that he had asked for the statement "to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done".
1305	The Los Angeles Times clarified that the area "described by the British press as Crenshaw" was in reality the "more upscale" area of Baldwin Hills. Writing for BBC News in September 2017, Regan Morris wrote that "When one newspaper dubbed Markle '(Almost) Straight Outta Compton' last year, there was an outcry" and that "If you read the British tabloid press you would think the actress grew up in LA's notorious gang culture and was lucky to escape a life of crime". In a January 2020 opinion piece for The New York Times, published in the wake of 'Megxit', the writer and broadcaster Afua Hirsch wrote that "From the very first headline about her being '(almost) straight outta Compton' and having 'exotic' DNA, the racist treatment of Meghan has been impossible to ignore".
1306	The headline was highlighted in the reaction to Meghan and Harry's interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021. Hanna Ziady wrote for CNN that "The first round of headlines back in 2016 played on harmful stereotypes and helped set the tone for how parts of the UK media, and especially its tabloid newspapers, would treat this newcomer to the royal family who stood out in one very obvious way: her race". Activist and lawyer Shola Mos-Shogbamimu wrote for The Guardian that she "[could not] believe that we are still having this debate about whether the way that Meghan has been treated is racist. It is misogynoir, pure and simple. Look at the media coverage of her. The Daily Mail said that she was "(almost) straight outta Compton"....That tells you what kind of society we live in". The headline was raised in an interview by Victoria Derbyshire with Ian Murray, the head of the Society of Editors. Derbyshire asked Murray if the headline was bigoted or racist, Murray replied that it was "disputed" as to whether the headline was offensive and said that it was "not acceptable" to describe sections of the British press as "bigoted". Murray described the article as a "rags to riches" story.
1307	"(Always Be My) Sunshine" is a hip hop song by American rapper Jay-Z with guest vocals from fellow femcee Foxy Brown and R&B singer-songwriter Babyface who performs the song's chorus. It serves as the first single from his second album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997). The track features production by Daven "Prestige" Vanderpool. Vanderpool samples MC Lyte's "Cha Cha Cha", Alexander O'Neal's "Sunshine", Kraftwerk's "The Man-Machine" and The Fearless Four's "Rockin' It" for the track's beat. In addition, George Fonenette plays keyboards on this song. The song's lyrics helped indicate Jay-Z's change from his Mafioso rap style to a more commercial "shiny suit" style. Steve Juon of RapReviews.com supports the song claiming that it is a less gangsta version of The Notorious B.I.G.'s "Me & My Bitch", a well-received track. Jay-Z cites this song as "what killed the album."
1308	Slade started recording their second studio album for RCA in 1982, and in November that year, the album's first single, "(And Now the Waltz) C'est La Vie", was released. Attempting to appeal to the Christmas market, it reached No. 50 in the UK, but fared better in Poland, reaching No. 2 there in January 1983, while also reaching No. 29 on Radio Luxembourg's chart. As the song was not the big UK hit that both the band and RCA hoped for, the new album The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome would not be released until December 1983. At the beginning of the year, RCA told the band that the album lacked potential chart hits and in the effort to amend that, the label hired producer John Punter to work on two new tracks "My Oh My" and "Run Runaway", both of which would go on to become big hits in 1983-84.
1309	"(And Now the Waltz) C'est La Vie" was described by Holder as a "sentimental love song". In a 1983 interview with Sounds, Lea said of the song: "We thought it was a ballad but when Dave Lee Travis played it, he said "That's Slade and now for a ballad" and put Lionel Ritchie on and then we realised ours wasn't a ballad at all. It came over like four idiots trying to tear their way out of the speakers." Holder also told Sounds in 1983: "It looked as if it was going to be quite a big hit but unfortunately it didn't get much above #50 in the charts."
1310	Eighteen years later, the song was covered by American singer Aaliyah for her debut studio album Age Ain't Nothing but a Number. Released as the album's second single, it peaked at number six on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number two on the R&B singles chart, it also peaked at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was certified gold single by RIAA on October 25, 1994. In 2010 Canadian rapper Drake sampled Aaliyah's version of the song in his song "Unforgettable" in his debut album Thank Me Later; four years later singer Tamar Braxton sampled this song for her single "Let Me Know" featuring Future. In 2017, Sevyn Streeter used an interpolation of the song for her hit, "Before I Do", the lead single from her album Girl Disrupted.
1311	BN-pairs can be used to prove that many groups of Lie type are simple modulo their centers. More precisely, if G has a BN-pair such that B is a solvable group, the intersection of all conjugates of B is trivial, and the set of generators of W cannot be decomposed into two non-empty commuting sets, then G is simple whenever it is a perfect group. In practice all of these conditions except for G being perfect are easy to check. Checking that G is perfect needs some slightly messy calculations (and in fact there are a few small groups of Lie type which are not perfect). But showing that a group is perfect is usually far easier than showing it is simple.
1312	After two albums of Powderfinger releasing singles that were either acoustic anthems (such as "My Happiness") or ballads ("The Metre" or "The Day You Come"), Powderfinger decided to release a heavy rock song as their new album, Vulture Street's lead single. In accordance with this, the band's publicity was geared towards a more rock oriented slant, with magazine covers and articles indicating that they were "returning to rock," alluding to the rock albums Parables for Wooden Ears and the highly successful Double Allergic, however some criticism was that the band's "rock" sound was different from previous releases, indicating that they were trying to be more like AC/DC than previously. Although the single for the song was released under the title of "On My Mind," the album cover has the song's title printed as "(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind."  It is alleged that Bernard Fanning implicitly wrote the lyrics as a tribute to former radio and television personality John Burgess.
1313	(Blooper) Bunny is a Merrie Melodies animated short film directed by Greg Ford and Terry Lennon, with music by George Daugherty, produced in 1991 by Warner Bros. Animation. Featuring the voice talents of Jeff Bergman and Gordon Hunt, the short is a parody of some of the specials produced for Bugs Bunny's 50th anniversary the previous year. The short never received its intended theatrical release and was shelved for six years. It was finally given a television premiere on June 13, 1997, after Cartoon Network discovered the film sitting unseen in the vaults. It is featured on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 1 as of 2003.
1314	The cartoon opens with a short special, celebrating Bugs Bunny's 51½th Anniversary Spectacular. Once that is finished, what happened earlier that day is shown, with a backstage look at the characters (featuring 3D rendering of the scenery). Bugs is shown rehearsing his one line in the special. Elmer Fudd is shown trying to use minoxidil to regrow his hair. Daffy Duck and Yosemite Sam are shown only begrudgingly going along with the act, complaining non-stop until called to their places by the director. They attempt a performance, which results in a series of animated "bloopers".
1315	Elmer Fudd fires a real gun as opposed to a prop, grazing Daffy's head. Bugs scolds him, but Elmer responds that he thought that it would be "a gweat, big birthday surpwise if after 51 ½ years of twying, [he] finally bwasted [Bugs]". Daffy starts yelling at Elmer for not using the prop gun and neglects Bugs's insistence on cutting. As he walks away telling Elmer to expect his lawyers to call him, he steps on the loose board Bugs had avoided earlier, and the board strikes him in the face and goes through his beak. When Bugs asks if they can cut now, Daffy grumbles, "You smug son of a—" and is then cut off.
1316	The spectacular performance is done perfectly, except for one thing, as Bugs puts it – there were supposed to be five rockets, but Sam replies "There were five! And I lit 'em, too!". The fifth rocket, attached to Sam's belt, sends him flying about before crashing into the camera. He then yells at Bugs, calling him a "low down flop-eared son of a kangaroo", along with his usual cursing (which lasts throughout the credits) before being silenced by an unseen glass object. Bugs then suggests that what had just happened can be fixed in the editing before one of the producers asks, "Can we go to lunch now?" The familiar "That's All Folks" runs up the screen at the very end as if written in the film emulsion (like on raw footage).
1317	(Blooper) Bunny was produced at a time when newer Looney Tunes shorts were being released to introduce the Warner cartoon characters to a younger, more modern generation — a process that was, thanks to the tepid reception of 2003's Looney Tunes: Back in Action, eventually discontinued for some time from 2004 to 2009. The film was animated using a combination of both new computer technology and traditional cel animation — a first for a Warner Bros. cartoon — with three-dimensional rendering distorting the background in the "backstage" scenes to give the appearance of a handicam being used. The first "backstage" scene in the film, a sequence that goes on for nearly a minute and a half without a cut, is, according to co-director Greg Ford, one of the single longest uninterrupted shots ever attempted in animated cartoons.
1318	The short features several direct references to some of the previous output of Warner Bros. animation department. During the first, aforementioned "backstage" scene, the name of Bosko, the first true Looney Tunes star, can be seen on one of the dressing room doors for a few frames (ironically, the Warner Bros. studio did not own the rights to Bosko at the time). Midway through the film, there is also a deliberate homage to the "Hunting Trilogy" made popular by Chuck Jones, of whom Ford reportedly holds great admiration. Additionally, during the end credits, the theme song of One Froggy Evening, another Chuck Jones creation, can be heard.
1319	"(Can't You) Trip Like I Do" is a reworking of "Trip Like I Do", a song featured on The Crystal Method's debut album Vegas.  The track was recorded for the 1997 film adaptation of the Spawn comic book series.  The song was co-written by Richard Patrick and co-produced by Brian Liesegang, both from Filter who also appeared in the song's video.  "(Can't You) Trip Like I Do" is the opening song on the film's soundtrack release, Spawn: The Album and is heard in the end credits. The song was also used for the theatrical trailer of The Matrix and promotional trailers for the Enter the Matrix video game but it does not appear in the film or on the soundtrack.
1320	(Chet Baker Sings) It Could Happen to You is an album by jazz trumpeter and vocalist Chet Baker. It follows a formula similar to two other Baker albums, Chet Baker Sings (1954) and Chet Baker Sings and Plays with Bud Shank, Russ Freeman & Strings (recorded in 1955, released in 1964) in which he sings traditional pop standards in a jazzy fashion. Unlike the aforementioned records, on It Could Happen to You, on a few tracks, Baker plays no trumpet whatsoever, opting to scat in place of an instrumental solo.
1321	Unlike most Miracles songs, which were written and produced by the group themselves, "I'm the One You Need" was written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team Holland–Dozier–Holland, best known for their work with The Supremes and The Four Tops. Holland-Dozier-Holland had written and produced two previous Miracles singles: the Top 10 hit "Mickey's Monkey" and the Top 40 hit "I Gotta Dance to Keep From Crying" (both 1963). "I'm the One You Need" was the final Miracles single released before lead singer Smokey Robinson was given star billing on all of the group's subsequent 45's.
1322	The single was a Top 20 Pop Hit, peaking at number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100, and a Top 10 R&B hit, peaking at number four on Billboard's R&B singles chart. In 1971, following the success of the #1 hit "The Tears of a Clown", Tamla-Motown UK decided to re-release this single instead of the newly-recorded follow-up, "I Don't Blame You At All". This re-release peaked at #13 in the UK in February 1971, and had a stronger showing than its late 1966 release, where it peaked at #37. "(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need" was the most successful single featured on their album Away We a Go-Go.
1323	The PIDA molecule is termed hypervalent as its iodine atom (technically a hypervalent iodine) is in its +III oxidation state and has more than typical number of covalent bonds.  It adopts a T-shaped molecular geometry, with the phenyl group occupying one of the three equatorial positions of a trigonal bipyramid (lone pairs occupy the other two) and the axial positions occupied by oxygen atoms from the acetate groups.  The "T" is distorted in that the phenyl-C to I to acetate-O bond angles are less than 90°.  A separate investigation of the crystal structure confirmed that it has orthorhombic crystals in space group Pnn2 and reported unit-cell dimensions in good agreement with the original paper.  The bond lengths around the iodine atom were 2.08 Å to the phenyl carbon atom and equal 2.156 Å bonds to the acetate oxygen atoms. This second crystal structure determination explained the distortion in the geometry by noting the presence of two weaker intramolecular iodine–oxygen interactions, resulting in an "overall geometry of each iodine [that] can be described as a pentagonal-planar arrangement of three strong and two weak secondary bonds."
1324	The (DoDI) 6130.03, 2018, section 5, 13f and 14m is the writing which bars persons with "true hermaphroditism" (ovotesticular disorder of sex development), "pseudohermaphroditism" and "pure gonadal dysgenesis" from serving in the United States Armed Forces. The three are all intersex conditions and are as of now considered to be medically incompatible with military service in the United States. "DoDI" stands for "Department of Defense Instruction", the 6130.03 instruction concerns "Medical Standards for Appointment, Enlistment, or Induction in the Military Services" in the Armed Forces of the United States. Section 5 focuses on disqualifying conditions of the male and female reproductive system, on the female page the subheader 13 and paragraph f names true hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism and pure gonadal dysgenesis specifically, and the on the male page subheader 14 and paragraph m also names exactly true hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism and pure gonadal dysgenesis. There is no differentiation made between males and females with the conditions. Many doctors, medical professionals and intersex advocates find the terms hermaphroditism to be outdated and stigmatized so it and its derivative words are seldom used in the 2000s, with the word Hermaphrodite itself being considered a slur when used against a human.
1325	"True hermaphroditism," which is clinically known as ovotesticular disorder of sex development, is a medical term for an intersex state in which a human is born with both testicular and ovarian tissue. Often one or both gonads is an ovotestis which contains both types of tissue. It is similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis but the conditions can be distinguished histologically. The condition has several effects on the body, one of which is imbalanced hormonal output, which is why it is currently considered a disqualifying condition for military service in the United States. 
1326	"Pseudohermaphroditism" on the other hand is an old clinical term for a person that is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics that are different from what would be expected on the basis of the gonadal tissue (ovary or testis). Use of the term "pseudohermaphroditism" can be problematic, and is now widely considered redundant. Because of this, the language still used by the armed forces has fallen out of favor in the 21st century due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the term Hermaphrodite.
1327	The guideline with the current wording was first conceived in 2010 and implemented in 2011. At first it was not addressed if persons who have had surgeries to address their genital abnormalities were acceptable or not but later updates added in notes about people also being barred if they had medical interventions done. In 2013 guidelines stated that "a history of, or current manifestations of, personality disorders, disorders of impulse control not elsewhere classified, transvestism, voyeurism, other paraphilias, or factitious disorders, psychosexual conditions, transsexual, gender identity disorder to include major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as change of sex or a current attempt to change sex, hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal dysgenesis or dysfunctional residuals from surgical correction of these conditions render an individual administratively unfit", which while specifying that only unsuccessful corrective surgeries for the conditions rendered someone unfit for service also lumped together disorders of sex development (DOSD) with gender identity, fetishes, mental illness, neuroatypicality, personality disorders and paraphilias in the same level of disqualification, which is not consistent or optimal for rules of enlistment. The 2016 amendments to the 6130.03 guidelines to allow transgender people to serve did not touch on intersex people whatsoever and their situation remained unchanged. At the time the location of the writing was at "Enclosure 4, 14f. and 15r", here it was listed as "major abnormalit[y] or defect of genitalia". The amendments made for transgender people were motivated by changes in the medical and psychological community, and while the use of the word hermaphroditism was criticized as archaic and medically outdated there was no major push by the larger LGBT community to have it corrected nor was any effort made on the part of the military to consider having it reworded.
1328	Day comments that "In a regular Hollywood situation it would have cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars", but the video was recorded in Whedon's closet three weeks prior to its general release.  Whedon stated that in directing the video (his first time "directing anything" according to his wife) he "basically wanted to do a relatively cliché dance video as if it were about medieval fantasy warriors who took themselves really seriously," in which respect he felt the cast delivered "perfectly and hilariously". He used stop motion techniques to compensate for those members of The Guild cast who do not have dancing skills. Then, to make it "legit" as a video, Whedon made sure to include "actual sexy footage of Felicia, stellar dancing with Amy [Okuda] showing off her chops, and of course, raining money."
1329	The recording of "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" arose out of James Brown's success in using the Mashed Potato dance as part of his stage show. Brown wanted to record a Mashed Potatoes-themed instrumental with his band in order to capitalize on the dance's popularity. However, King Records head Syd Nathan, a frequent critic of Brown's proposals, would not allow it. (The first instrumental recorded by Brown and his band, titled "Doodle Bee" and credited to Brown's tenor saxophonist J.C. Davis, had not sold well when it was released on King's sister label Federal Records.) Brown approached Henry Stone, a friend in the music business who ran the Dade Records label, about recording the piece with him. Stone, although nervous about crossing Nathan (with whom he did business), arranged for Brown to record at his Miami studio.
1330	"(Do The) Mashed Potatoes" was recorded with Brown playing the piano and shouting the song's title. To prevent Brown's voice from being recognized, Stone overdubbed shouted vocals by Carlton "King" Coleman, a local radio DJ, onto the recording, though Brown's voice remains audible in the background. Leadership of the band was officially credited to Nat Kendrick, who was Brown's drummer at the time, while the writing was credited to "Dessie Rozier", a pseudonym for Brown. A simple twelve bar blues tune, "(Do the) Mashed Potatoes" became a Top Ten R&B hit in 1960 and fed what would eventually grow into a national dance craze. The band recorded several more singles under the Nat Kendrick & the Swans name, including "Dish Rag", "Slow Down", and "Wobble Wobble", but none was successful. Eventually made aware of Brown's outside success, Syd Nathan relented and allowed him to release future instrumentals on King, starting with the 1961 single "Hold It" b/w "The Scratch".
1331	The video for "(Don't) Give Hate a Chance" is Jamiroquai's first computer-animated music video and pays homage to the Italian cartoon La Linea. To promote the release of the video, Sony BMG organised the video to be projected on a number of outdoor venues around central London, including the walls of the Chelsea Barracks military grounds and a car park in the Soho district. An alternate video released in late October, which included the ground being replaced by plants and rocks and significant changes to the final minute of the video.
1332	(Don't) touch me on my studio is a South African meme that developed out of an e.tv television interview, 7 April 2010, with André Visagie, former Secretary General of the far right group, the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB), and political analyst, Lebohang Pheko. The two were discussing race relations in South Africa in the aftermath of AWB leader Eugène Terre'Blanche's murder. Pheko confronted Visagie about the alleged abuse of farm workers in South Africa, and the anchor of the show, Chris Maroleng had to intervene when Visagie lost his temper, ripping off his microphone and storming off the set before returning and saying: "You won't dare interrupting me...I am not finished with you (sic)."
1333	The song is about the inevitability of death and the foolishness of fearing it, and was written when Dharma was thinking about what would happen if he died at a young age. Lyrics such as "Romeo and Juliet are together in eternity" have led many listeners to interpret the song to be about a murder-suicide pact, but Dharma says the song is about eternal love, rather than suicide. He used Romeo and Juliet to describe a couple who wanted to be together in the afterlife.  He guessed that "40,000 men and women" died each day, and the figure was used several times in the lyrics; this rate was 100,000 off the mark.
1334	"(Don't Fear) The Reaper" was written and sung by lead guitarist Buck Dharma and produced by David Lucas, Murray Krugman, and Sandy Pearlman. The song's distinctive guitar riff is built on the "i-VII-VI" chord progression, in an A minor scale. The riff was recorded with Krugman's Gibson ES-175 guitar, which was run through a Music Man 410 combo amplifier, and Dharma's vocals were captured with a Telefunken U47 tube microphone. The guitar solo and guitar rhythm sections were recorded in one take, while a four-track tape machine amplified them on the recording. Sound engineer Shelly Yakus remembers piecing together the separate vocals, guitar and rhythm section into a master track, with the overdubbing occurring in that order.
1335	The song was on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for 20 weeks, reaching number 12 for the weeks beginning November 6 and November 13 in 1976.  It was BÖC's highest-charting U.S. song and helped Agents of Fortune reach number 29 on the Billboard 200. "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" charted even higher in Canada, peaking at number 7. The single edit was released in the UK in July 1976 (CBS 4483) but failed to chart. However the unedited album version was released as a single (CBS 6333) in May 1978, where it reached number 16 on the UK Singles Chart.
1336	Critical reaction was mostly positive. Denise Sullivan of Allmusic praised the song's "gentle vocals and virtuoso guitar" and "haunting middle break which delivers the listener straight back to the heart of the song once the thunder is finished". Nathan Beckett called it BÖC's "masterpiece" and compared the vocals to the Beach Boys. Writing for PopMatters, James Mann hailed it as a "landmark, genre-defining masterpiece" that was "as grand and emotional as American rock and roll ever got". Pitchfork Media also referred to the song as a "masterpiece".  "Extremely poetic" was the verdict of Fountains of Wayne founder Chris Collingwood. "A sad ballad about a man who wants to die with his true love before their love is spoiled by earthly things."'
1337	The song was memorialized in the April 2000 Saturday Night Live comedy sketch "More Cowbell". The six-minute sketch presents a fictionalized version of the recording of "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" on an episode of VH1's Behind the Music. Will Ferrell wrote the sketch and played Gene Frenkle, an overweight cowbell player. "Legendary" producer Bruce Dickinson, played by Christopher Walken, asked Frenkle to "really explore the studio space" and up the ante on his cowbell playing. The rest of the band is visibly annoyed by Frenkle, but Dickinson tells everyone, "I got a fever, and the only prescription is more cowbell!" Buck Dharma said that the sketch was fantastic and he never gets tired of it but also lamented that it made the song lose its 'creepy' vibe for some time.
1338	The song was written by Mike Mills (credited to Berry/Buck/Mills/Stipe), in 1980, as a plea to his then girlfriend, Ingrid Schorr, not to return to Rockville, Maryland, where her parents lived. Schorr, who later became a journalist, has written about her amusement with the factual inaccuracies about her relationship with Mills and the background of the song that often appear in books about the band. Peter Buck has stated that the song was originally performed in a punk/thrash style, and that it was recorded for this single in its now more-familiar country-inspired arrangement as a joke aimed at R.E.M. manager Bertis Downs.
1339	Critical reaction to the track was generally positive with many reviewers comparing the song to the work of other groups such as Status Quo, ELO and The Beach Boys. A promotional music video was produced to accompany "(Drawing) Rings Around the World"'s release as a single. Directed by Pedro Romhanyi the video features images of fictional television stations including "SFA TV", which shows the band playing along with the track. An alternative video, directed by Sean Hillen, was included on the DVD version of Rings Around the World on its release in July 2001. This video features the lyrics to the track scrolling slowly from the bottom of the screen upwards in front of an image of a globe. The DVD version of Rings Around the World also includes a Llwybr Llaethog remix of "(Drawing) Rings Around the World".
1340	According to lead vocalist Gruff Rhys, "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" is about "all the rings of communication around the world. All the rings of pollution, and all the radioactivity that goes around. If you could visualize all the things we don't see, Earth could look like some kind of fucked-up Saturn. And that's the idea I have in my head – surrounded by communication lines and traffic and debris thrown out of spaceships." Rhys has claimed that the theory was initially his girlfriend's father's. The track was recorded in 2000 at Monnow Valley Studio, Rockfield, Monmouthshire and was produced by the Super Furry Animals and Chris Shaw.
1341	"(Drawing) Rings Around the World" is 3 minutes 29 seconds long and is in the key of B major. The track begins with feedback which plays while drums and a guitar, playing a riff based around a B chord, fade in. The first verse begins on 25 seconds with Gruff Rhys singing the lines "You expose the film in me, we're drawing rings around the world" backed by harmony vocals on the title phrase. A short bridge plays, during which the guitar chords change from B, E and F♯ to just E, F♯, E, F♯. Another verse, bridge and verse play before the last bridge which begins at 1 minute 23 seconds. The outro starts at 1 minute 32 seconds with Rhys singing "Ring ring, ring ring, rings around the world" over the chords B, D and F♯ backed by harmony vocals. A guitar counter-melody begins at 2 minutes 2 seconds and excerpts from phone calls the band made to random people around the world, including calls to the United States embassies in Madagascar and Moscow, a record shop in Osaka and a record company in Australia, play as the track fades out.
1342	A Llwybr Llaethog remix of "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" is included on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The track is 3 minutes 33 seconds in length and begins with a reed organ playing a riff in the key of B major. The remix largely follows the arrangement of the original but, for the majority of its duration, dispenses with the instrumental backing, featuring just Gruff Rhys's main vocals, the band's backing vocals and excerpts from the random phonecalls the group made alongside occasional organ and cymbals. Towards the end of the track the original version's guitar, drums and bass appear briefly before the song ends with the same reed organ riff that appeared at the start.
1343	Critical reaction to "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" was generally positive with many journalists comparing the song to the work of other groups. Writing for the NME, Ted Kessler described the track as "Status Quo for Generation X-ers with a Manhattan Portage full of millennial tension" and went on to ask "who said there was anything wrong with that?" in his review of the song on its release as a single, despite his earlier review of Rings Around the World claiming that the album would benefit from the removal of the "Status Quo-ish title track". Q described the track as "excellent" while PopMatters claimed the song "sounds so much like ELO that it blows away everything on last year's ELO reunion album" and the Dallas Observer stated that "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" is a "Beach Boys/Beatles/ELO homage as fine as the '70s heyday of Roy Wood's Wizzard or very early Cheap Trick". Pitchfork Media stated that the song "takes the upbeat Britpop of their debut album and layers on spectral details" while Uncut described the track as "tooled up rock 'n' roll modelled on "Surfin' USA". The Guardian claimed the song's lyrics tackle environmental issues with a "sharp wit" while Drowned in Sound saw them as evidence that chief songwriter Gruff Rhys was "taking his lyrics a little bit more seriously". The song was placed at number 21 in the 2001 Festive Fifty on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 show. "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" appeared on the soundtrack to the 2001 film Me Without You.
1344	The video begins with a static shot of the 1994 collage The Great Pyramids of Carlingford Lough, Irelantis by Hillen, which shows a man in a red jumper sat in a wooded area overlooking a river and three pyramids (this image was used for the front cover of all three formats of the single). The camera moves up to reveal a rotating globe in a stary sky. As "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" begins to play, the text "In the beginning... No! Long before that..." scrolls slowly from the bottom of the screen upwards. The song's lyrics are displayed in the same manner throughout the remainder of the video as several objects circle the globe including a flying saucer, metal cube and fireworks. Occasionally the camera switches to a close up view of the globe showing models of huge missile firing electricity pylons. As the song comes to an end the text "Every building has been built" appears in the middle of the screen and the camera pans down to show a black-and-white version of the Hillen collage used in the opening shot.
1345	The video begins with a shot of the band in an all white room playing along to the track. A station identification logo for "SFA television" is seen in the top left and a green graphic appears, showing the volume level being turned up. The camera pans back to reveal a TV which switches channel from "SFA" to a station showing golf. The rest of the video continues this pattern, continually flicking between the band and a variety of other stations, which generally feature similar logos to real life channels but with slightly different names e.g. "Cartoon Animals" (Cartoon Network), "CVQ" (QVC), "Animal Channel" (Discovery Channel) Actors, news presenters, puppets, a golfer, an astronaut and weatherman sing along with the track as the television stops on the channel each appears on. At one point, the band are shown in silhouette in homage to the cover of Hot Rocks 1964-1971 by The Rolling Stones. As the video ends, the camera pans back to show a television in a room with a man having a telephone conversation. The camera continues to pan back showing this image on a television on a shelf in a small room. The camera pans back through three more televisions, each showing an image of the last shot, ending with a TV in a wallpapered room next to an electric fire. A few seconds before the video ends the screen turns to static. The Pedro Romhanyi video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album Songbook: The Singles, Vol. 1 and the Enhanced CD version of the "(Drawing) Rings Around the World" single.
1346	(E)-Stilbene, commonly known as trans-stilbene, is an organic compound represented by the condensed structural formula C6H5CH=CHC6H5.  Classified as a diarylethene, it features a central ethylene moiety with one phenyl group substituents on each end of the carbon–carbon double bond.  It has an (E) stereochemistry, meaning that the phenyl groups are located on opposite sides of the double bond, the opposite of its geometric isomer, cis-stilbene.  Trans-stilbene occurs as a white crystalline solid at room temperature and is highly soluble in organic solvents.  It can be converted to cis-stilbene photochemically, and further reacted to produce phenanthrene.
1347	Bromination of trans-stilbene produces predominantly meso-1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane (sometimes called meso-stilbene dibromide), in line with a mechanism involving a cyclic bromonium ion intermediate of a typical electrophilic bromine addition reaction; cis-stilbene yields a racemic mixture of the two enantiomers of 1,2-dibromo-1,2-diphenylethane in a non-polar solvent such as carbon tetrachloride, but the extent of production of the meso compound increases with solvent polarity, with a yield of 90% in nitromethane.  The formation of small quantities of the two enantiomers of stilbene dibromide from the trans-isomer suggests that the bromonium ion intermediate exists in chemical equilibrium with a carbocation intermediate PhCHBr–C+(H)Ph with a vacant p orbital vulnerable to nucleophilic attack from either face. The addition of bromide or tribromide salts restores much of the stereospecificity even in solvents with a dielectric constant above 35.
1348	Disodium 4,4'-dinitrostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate is prepared by the sulfonation  of 4-nitrotoluene to form 4-nitrotoluene-2-sulfonic acid, which can then be oxidatively coupled using sodium hypochlorite to form the (E)-stilbene derivative in a process originally developed by Arthur Green and André Wahl in the late nineteenth century.  Improvements to the process with higher yields have been developed, using air oxidation in liquid ammonia.  The product is useful as its reaction with aniline derivatives results in the formation of azo dyes.  Commercially important dyes derived from this compound include Direct Red 76, Direct Brown 78, and Direct Orange 40.
1349	"(Evening) Time to Get Away" (sometimes referred to as simply "Time to Get Away") is part of a song from The Moody Blues 1967 album Days of Future Passed, a concept album with each song representing a part of the day. It was unlisted on the original album, but has been listed on many later reissues. The composition was written by bassist John Lodge, and is one of two compositions written by Lodge for Days of Future Passed, the other being "Peak Hour."  As the title suggests, the lyrics are about ending the work day and returning home. "(Evening) Time to Get Away" is part two of the track "Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?)", which also contains the Justin Hayward song "Tuesday Afternoon."
1350	"All Day" and "(Every Day Is) Halloween" are songs by American band Ministry, both written and produced by Al Jourgensen. These were originally released by Wax Trax! Records in 1984 as Ministry's “comeback” single following their departure from Arista Records, with "All Day" on the A-side and "(Every Day Is) Halloween" on the B-side, respectively. In 1987, these were included on Ministry's compilation Twelve Inch Singles (1981–1984). The remixed version of "All Day", titled “All Day Remix”, was featured on Ministry's 1986 album Twitch. “(Every Day Is) Halloween” has been featured in the 1998 Rhino Records compilation Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Halloween.
1351	The song has been covered by many artists, including The Brian Setzer Orchestra.  The TV show Ally McBeal borrowed the song's title for a December 11, 2000 episode that featured Vonda Shepard singing the song.   Her version was included in the holiday album Ally McBeal: A Very Ally Christmas. The album received positive reviews and several critics cited Shephard's version of the song as the album's highlight. Jane Monheit recorded the song for her 2005 album The Season, and performed it on her 2019 Holiday tour.   Seth MacFarlane recorded the song for his 2014 album Holiday for Swing.
1352	The song was an enormous chart success internationally, reaching the number-one position on the music charts of at least nineteen countries, notable exceptions in the Western World being Italy (number three) and Spain (number four). It is particularly notable for its success in the United Kingdom, where it spent sixteen consecutive weeks at number one on the UK Singles Chart, the longest uninterrupted run ever on that chart as of 2021. It also topped the Europe-wide sales chart for eighteen continuous weeks.  In the United States, it topped the Billboard Hot 100, which combines radio airplay and sales, for seven weeks, but stayed at number one for seventeen consecutive weeks on the sales-only chart. It went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, making it Adams's most successful song, and one of the best-selling singles of all time. The song has been covered by hundreds of singers and artists around the world.
1353	In the United States, the power ballad spent seven weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, which combines radio airplay and sales, the longest running number one song since 1983, and seventeen consecutive weeks at number one on the sales-only chart, which at the time set the all-time record for consecutive weeks at one. Billboard ranked it as the number-one pop song for 1991. It also held the number one spot on the US Adult Contemporary Chart for eight consecutive weeks, the longest run atop that chart since 1979, and was the number one song of the year on that chart.
1354	Adams, Kamen, and Lange won a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television, and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year at the Grammy Awards of 1992. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Song, but lost to "Beauty and the Beast." As recently as July 2020, it placed at number 13 on YouTube's "Most Listened to Rock Countdown", a monthly tally of the most viewed and listened to songs of the rock genre, both in current release and from the past; this was the second highest song by Adams' after "Please Forgive Me" at number 10. The song was placed 18th in a survey of the favourite songs of British readers of the Guinness Book of Records.
1355	The album includes the hit single "Have You Seen Her", which reached No. 1 on the R&B chart and No. 3 on Billboard Hot 100. It was also successful on the UK Singles Chart, reaching No. 32. The song was later covered by MC Hammer in 1990. The title track, which peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, No. 4 on the RB chart, and No. 32 on the UK Singles Chart, was featured on the soundtrack to the 1995 film Panther. Two other singles, "We Are Neighbors" and "I Want to Pay You Back (For Loving Me)", were released to moderate success. The album was the first of four consecutive Chi-Lites albums to make the R&B top 5, peaking at No. 3. It also reached at No. 12 on the pop chart.
1356	Relatively unusually for a K-pop girl group, (G)I-dle are directly involved in the creation of their music. In particular Soyeon has written or co-written (along with co-produced) the majority of the group's title song releases, with Minnie and Yuqi also co-writing a significant number of album songs. In conjunction with the release of their third EP I Trust in 2020, the group signed with Republic Records, an American record label, to pursue expansion into the U.S. marketplace. Upon its release, the group set the highest record for a South Korean girl group to top the iTunes Top Albums chart and the fourth girl group to sell 100,000 copies in the first week of sales. Their 2020 single album, Dumdi Dumdi broke the single album sales record, making it the second best selling girl group single album of all time. (G)I-dle also became the first K-pop group to get interviewed by Forbes China.
1357	In an interview with The Star, the leader of the group, Soyeon, revealed that the name "Idle" (아이들) came to her when she was composing the "Idle Song". She sent it to the company and the name was finalized after going through the company's competition. However, there were mixed reactions in South Korea and internationally because "아이들" (aideul) means "children" and "idle" in English refers to someone who avoids work. Accordingly, the group was renamed (G)I-dle, with the "I" standing for individuality, the hyphen to show that the name has been divided into two parts and "Dle" (deul) as the plural form of "I" in Korean, meaning a group of six different personalities gathered together. When the name is verbally mentioned, the G enclosed by the parentheses is not included.
1358	(G)I-dle released their debut EP, I Am, on May 2, 2018, with the lead single "Latata". The video for "Latata" exceeded 5.9 million views within the first week. The EP debuted at number 13 on the Gaon Album Chart issued on May 10. I Am also debuted at number seven and peaked at number five on Billboard's World Albums chart on May 9. A week after release, "Latata" debuted at number 35 on Gaon Digital Chart on May 17. (G)I-dle received their first-ever music show win on SBS MTV's The Show on May 22, twenty days after their debut. On June 5, they made their debut on Billboard's Social 50 Chart, charting at number 36.
1359	In July, (G)I-dle held their first U.S. performance during the annual KCON convention and music festival at Javits Center, New York City. They later held a live showcase at the Mainabi Blitz Akasaka on July 23. The showcase sold over 1,000 tickets with 1,500 attendants. It was reported that around 15,000 applied to attend, but due to the venue's capacity limit, some could not make it. On July 31, (G)I-dle debuted in the Japanese market with the release of their EP Latata. On August 19, (G)I-dle and makeup brand Kate collaborated to release a spin-off music video of "Latata (Japanese ver.)".
1360	(G)I-dle subsequently participated in a reality girl group survival show created by Mnet, Queendom. In the first preliminary round, (G)I-dle finished in first place after performing "Latata" re-imagined with a concept of shamanism. The introduction of the performance, Minnie's Thai "enchantment", was well received and became a hot topic among both Korean and Thai fans. In the second preliminary round, (G)I-dle reinterpreted 2NE1's "Fire", finishing in last place. In September, it was reported that Cube would partner with e2PR and Strategic Communications to establish a new promotion team for handling (G)I-dle's international public relations. That same month, the group held their first fan meeting, Welcome to the Neverland, at the Yes24 Live Hall in Seoul. Tickets to the show sold out in two minutes.
1361	On October 4, (G)I-dle performed as first-time main headliner at the Spotify On Stage Jakarta. They were one of the six acts including Rich Brian, Ateez, and others. On October 5, the group appeared on Immortal Songs 2, a KBS's reality television singing competition. This marked the group's first appearance on the program. They performed a rendition of Koyote's "Sad Dream" as a part of the group's 20th anniversary. (G)I-dle performed "Put It Straight (Nightmare Version)" for Queendom's Fan-dora's Box round. The stage performance reached one million views after fourteen hours of release, and placed fourth in the round. On October 25, (G)I-dle released "Lion" as part of the EP Queendom Final Comeback. By November 2019, the live performances of "Latata" and "Fire" had surpassed 11 and 13 million views, respectively. (G)I-dle finished the show in third place. "Lion" became a sleeper hit after gaining popularity on their stage concept of The Queen's Royal Welcome, re-entering the real-time charts of various music sites. A music video for it was released on November 4. The video surpassed five million views in two days. The song debuted at number 13 on the World Digital Song Sales and peaked at number five. Simultaneously, the single rose eighty-nine spots to number 19 on the Gaon Digital Chart and topped China's QQ Music Korean Song chart for two consecutive weeks. On December 21, (G)I-dle performed their hit singles at the 2020 Tainan Christmas & New Year Eve Party at Tainan City, Taiwan. Their stage was recorded the highest tide of the event of an appearance of 80,000 people.
1362	On April 6, the group released their third EP titled I Trust with "Oh My God" as its lead single. The album consists of five songs including an English-language version of the title track. In conjunction with the release of I Trust, (G)I-dle signed with Republic Records to help highlight and push their individuality into the U.S. marketplace. The album had over 91,311 pre-orders, making it their most pre-ordered EP, and it became their highest selling album by selling 100,000 physical copies in three days. I Trust debuted atop the Gaon Album Chart becoming (G)I-dle's first number-one album in South Korea and achieved their highest-ever position on Billboard's World Albums chart at number four, and set the highest record for a South Korean girl group to top iTunes Top Albums chart in 62 countries worldwide. The music video for "Oh My God" broke their personal record by amassing 17 million views within its first day of release, and was nominated for the 2020 MTV Video Music Award for Best K-Pop Video and BreakTudo's International Music Video. The song also marked the first time the group had appeared on the Scottish Singles Chart and charted at number 97, becoming only the third K-pop artist and the second female act to appear on the chart. (G)I-dle's live promotions for "Oh My God" won four music show awards including their first grand slam public broadcast win on KBS's Music Bank, SBS's Inkigayo and MBC's Show! Music Core. On May 6, (G)I-dle broke into Rolling Stone's Top 25 Breakthrough chart as the only K-pop group to chart for the month of April at the top 20 spot with a unit growth of 3.3 million and over 5.5 million total on demand audio streams in the U.S.
1363	In May, (G)I-dle released the official English version of their debut song "Latata" on May 15. On May 31, the group announced that they would be joining the 32-artist lineup at KCON:TACT 2020 Summer on June 23. The group was expected to release two albums in the second half of the year, including a digital single, according to an EBest Investment & Securities Co., Ltd researcher. (G)I-dle held I-Land: Who Am I as an online pay-per-view concert scheduled on July 5 instead of what would have been their first world tour. They performed songs from their debut album as well as "I'm the Trend", composed by Minnie and Yuqi, with a live audience of 11,000 real-time viewers. Subsequently, the group released the digital single, along with its music video on July 7 as a special present for their fans.
1364	On August 3, (G)I-dle released their first single album Dumdi Dumdi, with a lead single of the same name. With this release, Dumdi Dumdi ranked as the second best selling girl group single album in history with 94,587 initial sales. However, the song had a slow rise on the Gaon and Billboard charts. It debuted at numbers 27 and 15 on the Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Song Sales chart, and later peaked at numbers 8 and 13, respectively. On iTunes, the song topped in 42 regions in the world. The music video for "Dumdi Dumdi" garnered over 17.6 million views in a single day, breaking their previous record with "Oh My God". The group ended the promotions winning first place for two weeks in a row on Show Champion, M Countdown and Inkigayo, becoming the group's most-winning title track. On August 26, they made their first Japanese comeback with the release of their second extended play, Oh My God, along with the Japanese version of "Oh My God", "Uh-Oh", "Senorita", "Dumdi Dumdi" and an original Japanese track titled "Tung Tung (Empty)", which was composed by Minnie.

Both songs charted at number one on Billboard World Digital Song Sales, and were included in K/DA's first EP All Out.
1365	On January 11, the group released their fourth EP, I Burn, with its lead single, "Hwaa". According to Hanteo Chart, I Burn debuted at No. 1 on the daily album chart with 75,510 copies sold. The album also debuted at No.1 on Gaon Retail Album Chart with 59,086 copies sold. The music video for "Hwaa" scored 10 million YouTube views in 29 hours after it hit the streaming site. Two days later, the album was reported to be charted on the iTunes Top Album charts in 51 countries, including the Netherlands, New Zealand, Canada, Russia, Brazil, Italy and Finland. For the first time since their debut in 2018, all songs from I Burn was charted in Melon chart. Hwaa topped domestic charts and attained commercial success on Billboard charts, peaking at number 5 on K-pop Hot 100 and number 8 on World Digital Songs. Besides that, "Hwaa" achieved 10 music show wins, highest since their debut in 2018. (G)I-dle is also awarded triple crown with their new lead single, "Hwaa".
1366	Natalie Morin from Refinery29 described them as individuals with different energies that complement each other. She also described them as "bold and sensual", characteristics which she asserts sets them apart from other K-pop girl groups. Mor.bo named them as a diverse group that is unafraid to try different music styles. Elle magazine named the group as "independent musicians and artists" where girl groups' concepts typically work within a mould that was made by someone else. Chun Yoon-Hye of HeraldPop describes "(G)I-dle, a group filled with skills and confidence [...] engraved their presence by successfully expressing their exceptional concepts during Queendom [...] has gone from super rookie to trending girl group."
1367	(G)I-dle's songs have covered a wide variety of genres, crossing from "Latata" (moombahton trap), "Hann (Alone)" (moombahton), "Senorita" (Latin pop), "Uh-Oh" (boom bap), "Oh My God" (urban hip-hop) and "Dumdi Dumdi" (tropical moombahton). In the K-pop genre saturated with songs with themes of love and farewell, the group released "Lion", a song that diverges from a typical girl group song, comparing one's dignity to the dignity of a lion. In I Trust, the group explores elements of EDM trap, hip hop and urban music, with themes of self-love and self-trust.
1368	Taylor Glasby from MTV stated that (G)I-dle songs are steeped in their very essence — a girl's complex, internal house of mirrors that is constantly being broken, assessed, understood, and remade, where one style or sound is never enough to reflect who they are. (G)I-dle is the enticing tropical beats and coy finger snaps of "Latata" and the ominous, warning whistled hook of "Hann (Alone)". They are also the pensive harmonies and slow throb of bass on the R&B-infused ballad "Put It Straight," the whimsical words painted over the house music of "What's In Your House," and even the tango of "Senorita". Their lyrics push back, they beckon. They can be boring nonchalance or sharpening desire. Writing for Herald Pop, Kim Na-yul described (G)I-dle's genre can only be performed by them and made a good impression to the public. Melon's magazine described (G)I-dle's music generally as "Uniqueness is (G)I-dle's most powerful weapon." Korea JoongAng Daily journalist Yoo Seong-woon complimented the group for blending different elements from various sources into a unique mix of concepts and creating something new and fresh for the K-pop scene. (G)I-dle's summer song, "Dumdi Dumdi" was praised to have carried the legacy of summer songs.
1369	The group has also been praised for their stage presence during performances such as 2018 MMA's golden stage, reminiscent of Cleopatra, and 2018 MAMA's stage performing with dozens of female dancers to emphasize the image of women. It is also stated that their performance for Fan-dora's Box was "another legendary stage" due to the emotional acting by the members where they expressed "anger in sadness". (G)I-dle gave their last Queendom stage, "Lion" (with the Lion story narrated by Minnie), dancing in golden robes ornately decorated with a lion's mane, and finished with a herd of lions [dancers] following (G)I-dle to the six thrones. The stage was described as "world-class" and "legendary". This resulted in the group winning several performance awards, including Golden Disc Awards.
1370	The group is recognized for its brand recognition and marketing power, having topped the "Girl Group Brand Power Ranking" published by the Korean Business Research Institute, for June and September 2018. Their highest brand reputation index was in September 2018. (G)I-dle has been dubbed the "monster rookie" of 2018. Billboard ranked them at the top of its list as the best new K-pop acts of 2018. It was reported that Cube's music sales in 2018 increased by 58% to ₩8.8 billion due to the popularity of (G)I-dle's "Latata" and "Hann (一)".
1371	In 2019, (G)I-dle gained more recognition in the general public after appearing on Queendom. The performance of their finale song "Lion" was considered one of K-pop's biggest moments of 2019 by CTV News. This resulted in them topping the "Girl Group Brand Power Ranking" again for two consecutive months, October and November 2019. Rolling Stone India included "Lion" in their list of the 10 best K-pop music videos of 2019. The song was considered "one of the most visceral tracks of 2019" and was topped the list out of 920 songs released in 2019.
1372	In January 2020, (G)I-dle was voted as one of the most anticipated singers/groups in 2020 based on surveys of several Korean music agencies, broadcasting and program officials, composers and popular music critics. In February, the group achieved number one in ranking brand power with the most-interacted topics, "Lion", and world touring. According to Hyundai Motors Investment Firm, during the Coronavirus pandemic, Cube target shares increased by 36.67% due to (G)I-dle's growth with "Oh My God". On August 13, Cube released a report of their earnings in the second quarter of the year. The sales in the record and broadcasting sectors rose by 349% (₩2 billion) from a year earlier due to I Trust, which sold 151,108 copies, the success of I-Land: Who Am I, and Dumdi Dumdi raking up 98,587 album sales. The same month, they achieved 500 million streams cumulatively on Spotify. They are the first K-pop fourth-generation girl group and the fifth in the K-pop girl group's career in about two years and three months after their debut. On August 26, it was reported that they were the first K-pop group to get interviewed by Forbes China after a video interview was released through Forbes's official Weibo account.
1373	In 2020, Akiii Classic selected (G)I-dle as new models to reinforce the sensitivity of Gen Z's culture and trends pioneering the brand image. In early April 2020, (G)I-dle was revealed as a promotional model group for South Korea's biggest contact lens brand, LensMe. A representative from LensMe explained that the group's unique music and charismatic stage performances matched well with their "Basic, Trendy, Easy" company image. When choosing (G)I-dle as their models, the high fashion brand LipHop, emerging among young people predominantly in Korea, United States, Thailand, and Japan, stated that they considered the group to be "global artists who boast confident music and attractive visuals".
1374	(G)I-dle received their first music show win on SBS MTV's The Show with "Latata" on May 22, 2018. They won their first new artist award, "Female Rookie Idol of the Year", on July 24, 2018, at the Brand of the Year Awards, and went on to receive a total of seven rookie awards at various awards ceremonies in their debut year. In 2020, (G)I-dle won the International Music Video award at the 5th BreakTudo Awards with "Oh My God"—they also received a nomination for Best K-Pop Video at the 37th MTV Video Music Awards.
1375	Formed by Cube Entertainment in 2018, (G)I-dle debuted on May 2, 2018 with EP I Am with the song "Latata" as their first single. The group continued with the release of their first digital single titled "Hann (Alone)" on August 14, 2018 peaking at number 8 on the Gaon Digital Chart. They released their second mini album titled I Made on February 26, 2019 followed by the release of their second digital single titled "Uh-Oh" on June 26. A month later, (G)I-dle began their venture into the Japanese music market with the release of Latata on July 31. The same year, two more singles—"Put It Straight (Nightmare Version)" and "Lion"—was released through their participation in Mnet's survival show Queendom. "Lion" managed to gain commercial success and was nominated in Korean Music Awards. In April 2020, (G)I-dle's third EP, I Trust, and its lead single "Oh My God", were released on April 6. The EP became the group's best-selling album and scored the second-highest first-day sales by a girl group with 91,311 physical copies sold. It debuted atop the Gaon Album Chart with over 110,000 copies and scored their highest debut on Billboard's World Albums chart. In August 2020, they released 2 albums; Dumdi Dumdi, a special summer single album on August 3 with the title track of the same name, and the group's second Japanese mini album, Oh My God on August 26.
1376	(G)Old & New was recorded at Ike & Tina Turner's studio, Bolic Sound, in June 1973. The album was made due to popular demand, via requests to United Artists for an Ikettes album. The album features new compositions and new versions of old songs. The first hit single by the Ikettes "I'm Blue (The Gong-Gong Song)," was released in 1961. It reached No. 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and No. 3 on the R&B chart. They released two more charting singles in 1965, "Peaches 'N' Cream" (Pop No. 36, R&B No. 28) and "I'm So Thankful" (Pop No. 74, R&B No. 12).
1377	If     G   {\displaystyle G}  is a Lie group and     X   {\displaystyle X}  a Riemannian manifold with a faithful action of     G   {\displaystyle G}  by isometries then the action is analytic. Usually one takes     G   {\displaystyle G}  to be the full isometry group of     X   {\displaystyle X} . Then the category of      ( G , X )   {\displaystyle (G,X)}  manifolds is equivalent to the category of Riemannian manifolds which are locally isometric to     X   {\displaystyle X}  (i.e. every point has a neighbourhood isometric to an open subset of     X   {\displaystyle X} ).
1378	A developing map is defined as follows: fix     p ∈    M ~      {\displaystyle p\in {\tilde {M}}}  and let     q ∈    M ~      {\displaystyle q\in {\tilde {M}}}  be any other point,     γ   {\displaystyle \gamma }  a path from     p   {\displaystyle p}  to     q   {\displaystyle q} , and     φ : U → X   {\displaystyle \varphi :U\to X}  (where     U   {\displaystyle U}  is a small enough neighbourhood of     p   {\displaystyle p} ) a map obtained by composing a chart of     M   {\displaystyle M}  with the projection        M ~    → M   {\displaystyle {\tilde {M}}\to M} . We may use analytic continuation along     γ   {\displaystyle \gamma }  to extend     φ   {\displaystyle \varphi }  so that its domain includes     q   {\displaystyle q} . Since        M ~      {\displaystyle {\tilde {M}}}  is simply connected the value of     φ ( q )   {\displaystyle \varphi (q)}  thus obtained does not depend on the original choice of     γ   {\displaystyle \gamma } , and we call the (well-defined) map     φ :    M ~    → X   {\displaystyle \varphi :{\tilde {M}}\to X}  a developing map for the     ( G , X )   {\displaystyle (G,X)} -structure. It depends on the choice of base point and chart, but only up to composition by an element of     G   {\displaystyle G} .
1379	Bobby Troup got the idea for the song on a cross-country drive from Pennsylvania to California. Troup wanted to try his hand as a Hollywood songwriter, so he and his wife, Cynthia, packed up their 1941 Buick and headed west.  The trip began on US 40 and continued along US 66 to the California coast. Troup initially considered writing a tune about US 40, but Cynthia suggested the title "Get Your Kicks on Route 66". The song was composed on the ten-day journey and completed by referring to maps when the couple arrived in Los Angeles.
1380	(Get to) The Point is a short-lived current events discussion television program that aired on CNN in April 2013. Initially billed by CNN as "a week of special programming", the program was hosted by advertising executive and television personality Donny Deutsch with a panel that consisted of political commentator and gay rights activist Margaret Hoover, ESPN columnist Rick Reilly and ESPN NFL analyst Jason Taylor. A fifth panelist slot was filled by a different person each day. (Get to) The Point attracted a great deal of ridicule on Twitter during its time on air. Also during that time, the program averaged just 268,000 viewers with an average of merely 77,000 viewers in the 25-54 viewing demographic. It was also mocked by comedian Jon Stewart during his Comedy Central show. As a result of the low ratings, CNN's management decided not to continue with the show, cancelling (Get to) The Point after only a week of airtime.
1381	Stan Jones stated that he had been told the story when he was 12 years old by an old Native American who resided north-east of the Douglas, Arizona border town, a few miles behind D Hill, north of Agua Prieta, Sonora. The Native Americans, possibly Apache, who lived within Cochise County, believed that when souls vacate their physical bodies, they reside as spirits in the sky, resembling ghost riders. He related this story to Wayne Hester, a boyhood friend (later owner of the Douglas Cable Company). As both boys were looking at the clouds, Stan shared what the old Native American had told him, looking in amazement as the cloudy shapes were identified as the "ghost riders" that years later, would be transposed into lyrics. The melody is based on the song "When Johnny Comes Marching Home".
1382	"(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You" is a song by American boy band NSYNC. It was released as the third single from their self-titled debut album in the U.S. While some of the previous singles were released in Europe, this one was not, and subsequently only charted in Australia and the U.S., reaching number 46 and number 8 respectively. The single included a live version of Christopher Cross song "Sailing", as well as a limited edition postcard. Some versions of the single included the track's video. The radio version of this song was featured on both their first and third compilation albums: Greatest Hits (2005) and The Essential *NSYNC (2014).
1383	In a review of the single, Paul Massey of the Aberdeen Evening Express described Jackson as "a talented guy" and noted the song returned Jackson to "his Jumpin' Jive era". In a review of the Tucker soundtrack, Tom Moon of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered "(He's a) Shape in a Drape" to be "the most engaging" of the three tracks to feature vocals. Tomm Carroll, writing for the News-Pilot commented: "With a nod to the commercial, Tucker [features] a couple of vocal pieces compatible with the style of the score, [including] the swing-fest, "(He's a) Shape in a Drape"." Carroll added that the song "smacks of a hit single".
1384	Bowing at #99 on the Billboard Hot 100 on February 1, 1975, the hit became Thomas' second #1 single, on April 26, 1975. Including the parenthetical part, the title is the longest of any song to top the Hot 100.  (For comparison, the medley by Stars on 45, whose much longer title appeared at #1 on the 20 June 1981 Hot 100, consisted of snippets of 11 songs, not just one song.) It also topped Billboard's Easy Listening chart and was the last of his four Number Ones on that chart.  It also hit #1 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart. Billboard ranked it as the No. 17 song for 1975.
1385	"(Hey You) The Rock Steady Crew" is a song by American hip hop group the Rock Steady Crew from their debut studio album Ready For Battle. It was released in 1983 through Charisma/Virgin Records as the album's lead single. Written by Budd "Blue Soldier" Dixon, Ruza Blue and Stephen Hague, and produced by Dixon and Hague, the song became the most popular Rock Steady Crew's hit. The single peaked at number-one spot on Belgian and Dutch singles charts, and also reached the top ten in many European countries, including the UK. The song was featured in 2006 video game Scarface: The World Is Yours.
1386	The series' first season was shot on location at the real Hotel Beau Séjour ("Nice Stay") in Dilsen-Stokkem. The father of series co-creator Nathalie Basteyns stayed at the hotel 10 years before the show was created, and it made an impression upon him. Basteyns and Kaat Beels conceived the idea for the series immediately after this, when the child murders of serial killer Marc Dutroux were still fresh in people's minds. They elected to add a supernatural element to the story to set it apart from other similar neo-noir dramas currently airing. Lynn Van Royen, who portrays teenager Kato, was 28 and pregnant with her second child during the shoot. The creators and producers hope to make the series an anthology, with a different dead character in each season.
1387	In February 2019, it was announced that the city of Bruges and production house De Mensen had reached an agreement to film the second season in the village of Zeebrugge, a port on the coast of Belgium. Filming began in summer 2019 with Gene Bervoets cast in a main role. The second season will feature an all-new cast and storyline, albeit with a similar premise of a murder victim trying to solve his own death. It is expected to return in 2021. In December 2019, it was reported that Bervoets was injured during filming. He was treated at the hospital and released the same day.
1388	In 1998, Universal Music Group and the UEFA European Championship called a group of artists to record the official theme of the England national football team for the 1998 World Cup. The supergroup, credited as England United, was formed by the Spice Girls, Echo and the Bunnymen, Space and Ocean Colour Scene. The song was the final single by the Spice Girls released with Geri Halliwell's vocals, until the group's reunion in 2007. It was overshadowed however by "Three Lions 98" and "Vindaloo". It was released on 2 CD single formats on the same day, the first featuring the standard versions of the song, including an instrumental. The second featuring remixes by Perfecto and an alternative instrumental version. The sleeve designs were of the white home kit (CD1) and the away red kit (CD2).
1389	Although the song was a substantial chart hit in the UK, peaking at #9, critical reception to the song was largely negative. Chris Evans was quoted as saying: "It is a good pop song, but you can't sing it on the terraces. You can't really get your teeth into the lyrics." Charlie Porter in The Times said that it was "a snivelling apology for an official song" that "washes over you". Matthew Wright, writing in The Daily Mirror quoted footballers Ian Wright and Rio Ferdinand describing it as "bollocks" and "rubbish" respectively. In 2006 Guardian readers voted it the second worst England football song ever, after 1982's "This Time (We'll Get It Right)". BBC reporter Mark Savage describes the song as "clumsy and boring". When it was played at Wembley Stadium, it was booed by fans.
1390	The best-known version of the song was the original, recorded by Patti Page on December 18, 1952, and released in January 1953 by Mercury Records as catalog numbers 70070 (78 rpm) and 70070X45 (45 rpm) under the title "The Doggie in the Window", with the flip side being "My Jealous Eyes". It reached No. 1 on both the Billboard and Cash Box charts in 1953, and sold over two million copies. Mercury, however, had poor distribution in the United Kingdom. Therefore, a recording by Lita Roza was the one most widely heard in the UK, reaching No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in 1953. It distinguished Roza as the first British woman to have a number-one hit in the UK chart. It was also the first song with a question in the title to reach number 1.
1391	"Doggie" was one in a series of successful novelty songs since the 1930s, following on the success of songs such as Bing Crosby's "Pistol Packin' Mama" and Merv Griffin's "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts". Prior to the release of "Doggie", composer Bob Merrill penned "If I Knew You Were Comin' I'd've Baked a Cake". The original Page recording included the sounds of dogs barking, credited on the label as "Barks by Joe and Mac" (her arranger, Joe Reisman, and a violinist). The recording also features Page's signature multi-part tight harmonies, all sung by Page. Throughout the years, she recorded several other versions as well.
1392	Following the top ten entrance of Lita Roza's cover version on March 14, 1953, the Patti Page version of the song was released in the UK on March 28, renamed "(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window" (sans question mark), under Mercury's "Oriole Records" label. Given the delay getting to market in the UK, it was not as successful as the Roza version, only entering the charts at number nine before leaving the charts altogether five weeks later. The Roza version went to number one, lasting in that spot for one week. But for five weeks between 28 March 1953 and 25 April 1953, there were two versions of "Doggie" in the UK top twelve singles chart.
1393	Creative director Ken Levine commented on the use of the song in 2007 video game BioShock as choosing "the sort of crap pop of the time, what we consider pop music, like Patti Page, which holds up more for its nostalgic value than for being great music." He also remarked that the story of BioShock is "a sad story - not a horror story" and "we counterpoint it with [Patti Page's] '(How Much Is) that Doggie in the Window'". However due to licensing restrictions, Levine noted they had to use "another version of the recording" as the game does not use Page's original 1952 overdubbed Mercury recording and instead uses Page's 1966 re-recording with full orchestra for Columbia Records.
1394	"Doggie" was a new entry in the UK charts on 14 March 1953 at number nine. It moved up to number three in its second and third week of release before dropping down to number four on 4 April. On 11 April it moved up to number two for a week, before becoming number one on 18 April. This made Lita Roza both the first female vocalist to top the UK singles chart and the first person from Liverpool, long before the success of The Beatles or Cilla Black. It held the top spot for one week, before gradually dropping down the top ten over the next five weeks, with its final week in the top ten being at number nine on 23 May.
1395	Lita Roza was widely reported to have strongly disliked her song. In an interview in 2004 she revealed that she had kept her promise never to perform the song, "I sang it once, just one take, and vowed I would never sing it again. When it reached number one, there was enormous pressure to perform it but I always refused. It just wasn't my style." However, she would go on to be most widely remembered for that song. In 2001, Roza opened Liverpool's Wall of Hits on Matthew Street, home of The Cavern Club. On display were various discs from every British number-one from Merseyside, the first being her own.
1396	(How to Live) As Ghosts, is the eighth studio album by American rock band 10 Years. While their prior album, From Birth to Burial alluded to the band's plan at the time for it to be their final album, (How to Live) As Ghosts alludes to the sentiment of it being a rebirth of a band, while also alluding to the general sentiment that humanity spends too much time worrying about death rather than life. The album's first single, "Novacaine" was released in August 2017. The second single, "Burnout" was released April 23, 2018.
1397	In 2015, the band released their seventh studio album, From Birth to Burial, deriving from the fact that frontman and lead vocalist Jesse Hasek believed it to be the band's final album. The sessions for the prior album had been difficult for the band, with long-time members Matt Wantland and Brian Vodinh leaving in 2013, after over a decade of involvement in the band, with Hasek conceding that it "just didn't feel like 10 Years without [them]." However, Hasek reconnected with the two after the release of the prior album, and after rejoining, began work on a new album in 2016.
1398	For the first time since 2008's Division, the album's core writing team again consisted of Hasek, Vodinh, and Wantland again. However, this time they approached writing differently; historically, Hasek and Vodinh would do the bulk of the writing together, and then have the rest of the band members add minor nuances to the songs. For (How to Live) As Ghosts, all of the music was written as a full-band and collaborating with music producer Nick Raskulinecz. Vodinh provided guitar and drums for the album, relegating newcomer Kyle Mayer as merely the live drummer for touring. The track "Blood Red Sky" originated from a solo EP recorded by Vodinh, but was reworked by Hasek to have a vastly different vocal approach.
1399	In the past, I've written a lot of songs that were pretty ambiguous. But on this record, I'm more comfortable being direct and talking about things that are important to me. I'm older and find myself reflecting on the world more especially after having travelled the world and talk to people and really see what's going on...seeing all the political, social, and religious turmoil, it had me thinking about how many people are judging and preparing for death, but are actually missing life. And, instead of using spirituality for good, a lot of people use it to point fingers and judge. Instead of worrying where we end up in the end, we need to focus on the now and the humanity.
1400	The song was first released in March 1985 as the lead single from Sandra's debut album The Long Play. It was her third single as a solo artist, but the first solo single to be released internationally. Initially unsuccessful in its bid to gain radio play, the label targeted DJs in Greece and their tourist audiences next, and the song subsequently became a big hit in Greece, where it topped the singles chart. Returning tourists requested the song at home, and it eventually reached number one on the official German singles chart for four consecutive weeks between 13 September and 4 October 1985. The single then peaked at number one in Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Finland. It also reached number 1 on the airplay chart in Germany as well as the top 5 in Austria. In the pan-European charts, it was a top 10 and a top 20 hit on the airplay and sales charts, respectively. The song was also a popular radio hit song in Brazil, the Middle East, Northern Africa and Eastern Europe.
1401	The song was re-released in a remixed version as a standalone single in 1993, but was not commercially successful, though it reached the top ten in Finland and the top twenty in Denmark. Music website AllMusic retrospectively rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars. In 1999, another remix of the song was released only in France as a promotional single in support of her compilation album My Favourites. The track was remixed again for her remix album Reflections (2006), and the original version was later sampled in the song "Kings & Queens" on her tenth album Stay in Touch (2012).
1402	(I'm) Stranded is the debut album by Australian punk rock group The Saints which was released by EMI on 21 February 1977. Their debut single, "(I'm) Stranded", was issued ahead of the album in September 1976, which Sounds magazine's reviewer, Jonh Ingham, declared was the "Single of this and every week". "Erotic Neurotic" was the second single, which was released in May 1977 and the group relocated to the United Kingdom. In June, bass guitarist Algy Ward replaced Bradshaw and the group issued a single, "This Perfect Day" in July, which peaked in the Top 40 on the UK Singles Chart.
1403	The Saints formed in Brisbane in 1973 with original members Chris Bailey (singer-songwriter, later guitarist), Ed Kuepper (guitarist-songwriter), and Ivor Hay (drummer). In 1975, Kym Bradshaw joined on bass guitar. Contemporaneous with Ramones, the group were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and "buzz saw" guitar that characterised early punk rock. Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. According to Australian rock historian, Ian McFarlane, they had developed their "own distinctive sound as defined by Kuepper's frenetic, whirlwind guitar style and Bailey's arrogant snarl".
1404	In June 1976, The Saints recorded two tracks, "(I'm) Stranded" and "No Time" with Mark Moffatt producing. Unable to find an interested label, they formed Fatal Records and independently released the two tracks as their debut single in September 1976. Their self-owned Eternal Promotions sent discs to radio stations and magazines both in Australia – with little local interest – and the United Kingdom. In the UK, a small label, Power Exchange, issued the single. Sounds magazine's reviewer Jonh Ingham declared it, "Single of this and every week". EMI head office in London contacted the Sydney branch and directed that they be signed to a three-album contract.
1405	Over two days in December, the group recorded their first LP album, (I'm) Stranded (21 February 1977), with Rod Coe producing. Kuepper said later that the album was "basically our live set and were also the oldest songs. And in particularly with 'Nights In Venice' and 'Messin' With The Kid', they were the first two songs we ever did." It included a cover version of The Missing Links' track "Wild About You". On the single tracks "(I'm) Stranded" and "No Time", Kuepper's guitar was tuned up a semitone, to emulate Bo Diddley. The other eight tracks were recorded over a weekend in December 1976. Kuepper used Mark Moffatt's 1960 Fender Super amp with no effect pedals on (I'm) Stranded and No Time. On the remainder of the album he used a vocal PA as his guitar amp, after his live amp had "blown up", and an MXR Distortion Plus pedal. The band recorded the tracks live, though with the guitar amp in the corridor to avoid spill.
1406	In May 2001, Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA) celebrated its 75th anniversary and named "(I'm) Stranded" in its Top 30 Australian songs of all time. In 2007, "I'm Stranded" was one of the first 20 songs stored on the National Film and Sound Archive's Sounds of Australia registry. Their debut album was listed at No. 20 in the book 100 Best Australian Albums in October 2010. Fact ranked it the 20th best album of the 1970s in 2014, calling it "easily one of the best – and probably the noisiest – albums to emerge from punk’s first wave."
1407	The Saints were formed in Brisbane in 1973, initially calling themselves Kid Galahad and the Eternals. They are considered to be one of the first and most influential punk groups. The Saints rehearsed in the front room of the rented house on Petrie terrace, Brisbane, which happened to be opposite the local police headquarters. By 1975, contemporaneous with the Ramones, The Saints were employing the fast tempos, raucous vocals and "buzzsaw" guitar that characterised early punk rock. Guitarist Ed Kuepper explained that they played faster and faster as they were nervous in front of audiences. The police would often break up their performances, and arrests were frequent. They found it difficult to get bookings in Brisbane and so formed their own promotion company, their own club (Hay's place became the 76 Club) and their own record label.
1408	The song was played by influential DJ John Peel in a special punk-themed edition of his BBC Radio 1 programme, broadcast on 10 December 1976. Bob Geldof of The Boomtown Rats later said, "Rock music in the Seventies was changed by three bands—the Sex Pistols, the Ramones and The Saints". EMI Records in Sydney was contacted by its London head office and told to sign the punk band from Brisbane. The Saints resisted being re-modelled into the English punk look and were generally ignored by the Australian press at the time, which reported that "a sinister new teenage pop cult, based on sex, sadism and violence, is sweeping Britain." They relocated first to Sydney and then to London, where they were received with excitement on their first regional tour. They did not share the spiky-topped, safety-pinned style of the leading UK punk groups and preferred to be described as "gutsy realists". Kuepper recalled that, nevertheless, they were swept up in the same punk packaging:
1409	"Presence, Dear" was released as the second single from Plastic Letters. It was issued in both 7" and 12" formats in the UK, with two songs on the B-side, as were previous singles, "Rip Her to Shreds" and "Denis". One of the single's B-side tracks was "Detroit 442", and the other was Jimmy Destri's "Poets Problem", which was not on the original release of Plastic Letters. "Poets Problem" was first issued on CD on the 1993 rarities compilation Blonde and Beyond and later as a bonus track on both the 1994 and 2001 re-releases of Plastic Letters.
1410	"Presence, Dear" has seen critical acclaim since its release. Stewart Mason of AllMusic wrote, "It's one of the group's early highlights, a sweet little power pop love song that features a brilliantly starry-eyed lyric set to an addictive jangly guitar riff. The missing link between Big Star's #1 Record and the dB's Stands for Decibels, '(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear' pulls off the difficult trick of being dryly ironic and utterly sincere at the same moment." The Rolling Stone Album Guide called the song a "catchy single" that "taps into Harry's emotional reserves."
1411	GQ ranked the song as Blondie's second best, writing, "If you ever doubted Blondie's ability to be funny, intelligent, culty and yet bubblegum, it's here in the lines of this song: 'We could navigate together, psychic frequencies / Coming into contact with outer entities / We could entertain each one with our theosophies.'" The Daily Telegraph ranked it as one of the band's ten best songs, praising Harry's "glacial" vocals and describing the melody as "so insistent, you might need an exorcist to get it out of your head." New Times Broward-Palm Beach named the song as one of Blondie's five most underrated, noting, "Harry made its sweet ode to infatuation convincing."
1412	"(I'm Gonna) Love Me Again" is a song from the 2019 biopic Rocketman. Written by Elton John and Bernie Taupin, the song was performed by John and Taron Egerton, who portrayed John in the film. The song is heard in the end credits of the film. The official music video features both archival clips from John's early career as well as scenes from the film. The song won numerous accolades including "Best Original Song" at the 77th Golden Globe Awards, "Best Song" at the 25th Critics' Choice Awards, "Best Original Song" at the 24th Satellite Awards, and Best Original Song at the 92nd Academy Awards.
1413	The various Monkees' versions differ across the single, stereo album, and mono album versions. In the stereo version, the track's title is sung just before the second verse, whereas on the single and mono album versions, this segment is left instrumental. Additionally, the stereo version has an edit in the fade out. The mono album version does not have this edit and therefore has a longer coda. The single also does not have the edit, but it fades the song earlier than the mono album. All Monkees' hits compilations through the mid-1980s used the stereo version, and afterward typically used the single version.
1414	Singer-songwriter Previte was the lead singer of the band Franke and the Knockouts. He had success with the song "Sweetheart" in 1981, but by 1986 was without a recording contract. In late 1986 or early 1987, producer and head of Millennium Records, Jimmy Ienner, asked Previte about writing some music for "a little movie called Dirty Dancing". Previte initially turned the request down because he was still trying to get a record deal, but Ienner was persistent, and got Previte to write several songs for the film, including "Hungry Eyes", later recorded by singer Eric Carmen, which also became a top 10 hit.
1415	Previte wrote the lyrics, and the music was written by John DeNicola and Don Markowitz. After getting further approval, Previte created a demo of the song, performing on it himself, along with singer Rachele Cappelli. The demo showcased how the harmonies were to be used, employing a "cold open", or a slow build-up of the song to its finale. This demo wasn't used in the final cut of the film − the more polished version with Warnes and Medley was. However, because the Warnes/Medley track was not ready by the time the finale was filmed (it was shot first, due to the tight budget), Previte and Capelli's much lighter and more youthful version was used as a backing track, so that the actors, Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey, and the dancers, could have something to dance to (Swayze had later remarked it was his favorite version, even including all the subsequent remakes). The demo version finally appeared on the 1998 CD reissue of Previte's 1981 album Franke and the Knockouts, but is only listed as "Bonus Track".
1416	The song was initially intended for Donna Summer and Joe Esposito, but Summer turned it down because she didn't like the title of the film.   Bill Medley was approached by Jimmy Ienner repeatedly over two months to do the recording, but he also turned it down because his daughter McKenna was due to be born, and he had promised his wife he would be there.  After the birth of his daughter, Medley was approached again, because Jennifer Warnes had indicated she would record the song if she could do the duet with Medley.  Medley then agreed to record the track. With the release of the film it became a worldwide hit, and is one of the most frequently played songs on radio.
1417	The track was written during a period Clapton experimented with minimalistic guitar riffs and Pro Tools along with his collaborator Simon Climie, while being in the recording sessions for the 1998 Pilgrim studio album. "(I) Get Lost" starts with a guitar line that featured Clapton playing an acoustic guitar with nylon strings. As the song evolves, percussions, strings and synthesizers come into action. The recording was produced by Simon Climie and Clapton himself. The song starts out in a key of A major. The song's lyrics tell the story of a man, who is longing for his either his girlfriend or lifelong love and feels himself lost in tears and apprehensibility.
1418	The song was originally written and recorded as part of the movie soundtrack to the 1999 film The Story of Us, where the song was featured along with the "Main Title" (also composed by Clapton for the movie) in the very beginning. It was later released with the soundtrack compact disc under Reprise Records. The pop title was also released as a compact disc and vinyl single on 23 November 1999. In Germany, the single was re-released in 2000. Besides being released in Europe and the United States, the CD single was also made available in Japan and Mexico.
1419	Music critic Dan Goldwasser of Soundtrack.NET calls the song an "upbeat song" which "immediately grabs the listener". Additionally, the "(I) Get Lost" has got an important part of making the movie soundtrack The Story of Us a "relaxing score". The music website AllMusic rates the single release with one and a half of five possible stars. Billboard magazine's Chuck Taylor thinks, "you will be speechless" after hearing the single, because the release is an "absolutely enchanting and bold effort by this timeless artist to step to the late–1990s plate instead of letting reflective ballads redefine his image as an aging AC balladier". Taylor goes on in his review for the music magazine, stating: "Every element of this song shines, from its light but intelligent lyric about being lost without the one he loves (though, at the same time implicationg her as less than the perfect mate) to an overwhelmingly catchy chorus. But it's the production that will elevate 'Lost' above the pop patter out there, with its dignified demeanor wrapped in a toe-tapping vibe that will delight the nation. Even the die-hards who look back to his simpler rock days will find an appreciation in this ditty, a sure step forward for an artist who demands to be noticed by the mainstream this time around. This is surprising, great fun and a sure-fire hit".
1420	(I Am) Nobody's Lunch takes on the question that was on the minds of many Americans as the Bush Administration began to launch the Iraq War: Who, or what, do we believe? It presents a dynamic range of real-life perspectives from across the country, from an Arab-American cab driver to a staffer at the Department of Homeland Security, everyone in the phone book listed under the name Jessica Lynch, an elderly Jewish woman, and even an alien. According to Sam Marlowe, in his review of (I Am) Nobody's Lunch when it played at the SoHo Theater in London, the play "considers the impossibility of certainty in a world stuffed with lies."  The scenes and monologues from Cosson's script are interspersed with composer Michael Friedman's musical numbers, producing a cabaret-like piece of theatre.
1421	An early version of the play opened in September 2004 and was produced by The Civilians and presented by Performance Space 122. (I Am) Nobody's Lunch had its official U.S. Premiere by The Civilians at 59E59 Theaters, New York City, January 19, 2006. The play then received its London Premiere by The Civilians at Soho Theatre on September 6, 2006, after playing an award-winning run at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival earlier that year. (I Am) Nobody's Lunch also  toured along the East Coast during April 2006, playing shows at the Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts in Philadelphia, PA (April 19 – 23, 2006) and the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA (April 25 – 30, 2006).
1422	The UK release had no artwork and was issued in a generic sleeve, however the other releases of the single featured picture sleeves. The Netherlands sleeve featured a photograph of the entire band, using black and light red as the only colours. The German release featured a close-up shot of Harley in front of a microphone on stage, while the Belgian release had no photograph, using the band's name and song title as large text with a blue background instead. The Japanese release featured the same artwork as the Love's a Prima Donna album. All sleeves of the single named the song as "Love is a Prima Donna", although the actual vinyl used the song's full title.
1423	In a 1976 issue of the EMI Records Weekly News magazine Music Talk, Rex Anderson reviewed the Love's a Prima Donna album. He compared the track "(Love) Compared with You" with the title track: ""(I Believe) Love's a Prima Donna" is a brilliant contrast. The guy has been through all the different pangs of adolescent love and comes to the realisation that "love" is a prima donna." Later in the review, Anderson also noted: "Tony Rivers deserves some praise for his vocal arrangements, particularly on "(Love) Compared with You" and "Love's a Prima Donna"." In a review of the album, American magazine Billboard picked the song, along with "(Love) Compared with You", as the album's best cuts.
1424	The official music video was shot over the Thanksgiving holiday in Tokyo. It was directed by Thom Glunt and released on January 15, 2014. In the video, after a night of drinking, the band members wake up alone in different parts of Tokyo — Rocky in a rolled up carpet on the streets, Riker in a hotel room full of girls, Rydel in a box with vegetables, Ratliff in a car and Ross on a bench next to a guy. They are hungover and don't remember the show that should do that night. They had to use clues given to them by people to reconnect to each other and remember the show. At the end of the video, the members agree again in different places alone after a new night of drinking.
1425	Keith Richards wrote "Satisfaction" in his sleep and recorded a rough version of the riff on a Philips cassette player. He had no idea he had written it. He said when he listened to the recording in the morning, there was about two minutes of acoustic guitar before you could hear him drop the pick and "then me snoring for the next forty minutes". Sources vary as to where this story happened. While they make reference to a hotel room at the Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida, a house in Chelsea and the London Hilton, Richards wrote in his most recent autobiography that he was in his flat in Carlton Hill, St. John's Wood. He specifies that Mick Jagger wrote the lyrics by the pool in Clearwater, four days before they went into the studio, hence the confusion.
1426	The Rolling Stones first recorded the track on 10 May 1965 at Chess Studios in Chicago, Illinois, which included Brian Jones on harmonica. The Stones lip-synched to a dub of this version the first time they debuted the song on the American music variety television programme Shindig! The group re-recorded it two days later at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California, with a different beat and the Maestro fuzzbox adding sustain to the sound of the guitar riff. Richards envisioned redoing the track later with a horn section playing the riff: "this was just a little sketch, because, to my mind, the fuzz tone was really there to denote what the horns would be doing." The other Rolling Stones (Jones, Watts, & Wyman), as well as producer and manager Andrew Loog Oldham and sound engineer David Hassinger eventually outvoted Richards and Jagger so the track was selected for release as a single. The song's success boosted sales of the Gibson fuzzbox so that the entire available stock sold out by the end of 1965.
1427	Like most of the Stones' pre-1966 recordings, "Satisfaction" was originally released in mono only. In the mid-1980s, a true stereo version of the song was released on German and Japanese editions of the CD reissue of Hot Rocks 1964–1971. The stereo mix features a piano (played by session player Jack Nitzsche, who also provides the song's iconic tambourine) and acoustic guitar that are barely audible in the original mono release (both instruments are also audible on a bootleg recording of the instrumental track). This stereo mix of "Satisfaction" also appeared on a radio-promo CD of rare stereo tracks provided to US radio stations in the mid-1980s, but has not yet been featured on a worldwide commercial CD; even later pressings of the German and Japanese Hot Rocks CDs feature the mono mix, making the earlier releases with the stereo mix collectors' items. For the worldwide 2002 reissue of Hot Rocks, an alternative quasi-stereo mix was used featuring the lead guitar, bass, drums, and vocals in the center channel and the acoustic guitar and piano "split" left and right via a delay effect.
1428	The song opens with the guitar riff, which is joined by the bass halfway through. It is repeated three times with the drums and acoustic guitar before the vocal enters with the line: "I can't get no satisfaction." The key is E major, but with the 3rd and 7th degree occasionally lowered, creating – in the first part of the verses ("I can't get no ...") – a distinctive mellow sound. The accompanying chords (i.e. E major, D major and A major) are borrowed from the E mixolydian scale, which is often used in blues and rock.
1429	The title line is an example of a negative concord. Jagger sings the verses in a tone hovering between cynical commentary and frustrated protest, and then leaps half singing and half yelling into the chorus, where the guitar riff reappears. The lyrics outline the singer's irritation and confusion with the increasing commercialism of the modern world, where the radio broadcasts "useless information" and a man on television tells him "how white my shirts can be – but he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke the same cigarettes as me", a reference to the then ubiquitous Marlboro Cowboy style advertisement. Jagger also describes the stress of being a celebrity, and the tensions of touring. The reference in the verse to not getting any "girl reaction" was fairly controversial in its day, interpreted by some listeners (and radio programmers) as meaning a girl willing to have sex. Jagger commented that they "didn't understand the dirtiest line", as afterwards the girl asks him to return the following week as she is "on a losing streak", an apparent reference to menstruation. The song closes with a fairly subdued repetition of the song's title, followed suddenly by a full shout of the line, with the final words repeated into the fade-out.
1430	In its day the song was perceived as disturbing because of both its sexual connotations and the negative view of commercialism and other aspects of modern culture; critic Paul Gambaccini stated: "The lyrics to this were truly threatening to an older audience. This song was perceived as an attack on the status quo." When the Rolling Stones performed the song on Shindig! in 1965, the line "trying to make some girl" was censored, although a performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on 13 February 1966 was uncensored. Forty years later, when the band performed three songs during the February 2006 Super Bowl XL halftime show, "Satisfaction" was the only one of the three songs not censored as it was broadcast.
1431	"Satisfaction" was released as a single in the US by London Records on 5 June 1965, with "The Under-Assistant West Coast Promotion Man" as its B-side. The single entered the Billboard Hot 100 charts in America in the week ending 12 June 1965, remaining there for 14 weeks, reaching the top on 10 July by displacing the Four Tops' "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". "Satisfaction" held the number one spot for four weeks, being knocked off on 7 August by "I'm Henry the Eighth, I Am" by Herman's Hermits. While in its eighth week on the American charts, the single was certified a gold record award by the RIAA for shipping over a million copies across the United States, giving the band their first of many gold disc awards in America. Later the song was also released by London Records on Out of Our Heads in America. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 song of 1965.  Billboard said of the single that a "hard-driving blues dance beat backs up a strong vocal performance."
1432	In the decades since its release, "Satisfaction" has repeatedly been acclaimed by the music industry. In 1976, Britain's New Musical Express listed "Satisfaction" 7th among the top 100 singles of all time. There was a resurgence of interest in the song after it was prominently featured in the 1979 movie Apocalypse Now.  In 1991, Vox listed "Satisfaction" among "100 records that shook the world". In 1999, BMI named "Satisfaction" as the 91st-most performed song of the 20th century. In 2000, VH1 listed "Satisfaction" first among its "Top 100 Greatest Rock Songs"; the same year, "Satisfaction" also finished runner-up to "Yesterday" in a list jointly compiled by Rolling Stone and MTV. In 2003, Q placed the song 68th out of its "1001 Best Songs Ever".  Newsweek magazine has called the opening riff "five notes that shook the world".
1433	Otis Redding recorded a rendition of "Satisfaction" for his album Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, released in 1965. Redding claimed that he did not know the lyrics of the song. "I use a lot of words different than the Stones' version," he noted. "That's because I made them up." Of that session, Steve Cropper said, "...if you ever listened to the record you can hardly understand the lyrics, right? I set down to a record player and copied down what I thought the lyrics were and I handed Otis a piece of paper and before we got through with the cut, he threw the paper on the floor and that was it." Music writer Robert Christgau described it as an "anarchic reading" of the Stones' original. Redding's soul-style arrangement featured horns playing the main riff, as Keith Richards had originally intended. In 2003, Ronnie Wood noted that the Rolling Stones' later concert renditions of the number reflect Redding's interpretation.
1434	The American avant-garde/experimental collective the Residents recorded and released their own performance of "Satisfaction" in 1976. Originally released in an edition of only 200 copies, the cover quickly became a cult sensation, thanks in part to the success of Devo's cover the following year, necessitating a re-press in 1978 of 30,000 copies. Brad Laner, writing for Dangerous Minds, states the cover "is nearly everything the better known version by Devo from a year later is not: Loose, belligerent, violent, truly fucked-up. A real stick in the eye of everything conventionally tasteful in 1976 America."
1435	The American new wave band Devo released their rendition of "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" as a single in 1977, initially in a self-produced version on their own label Booji Boy Records. The song was re-recorded with Brian Eno as producer for their first album, and that version was also released as a single in 1978, this time by Warner Brothers Records, after it was played for Mick Jagger's approval. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that the cover version "reworks the original's alienation into a spastic freak-out that's nearly unrecognizable". This version of the song was featured prominently in the 1995 Martin Scorsese epic crime film  Casino. Devo's version also featured in Netflix's series Sex Education.
1436	"(I Can't Help You) I'm Falling Too" was recorded on May 13, 1960, at the RCA Victor Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, United States. The song was released as a single in July 1960, and it peaked at number two on the Billboard Magazine Hot C&W Sides chart later and number thirty nine on the Billboard Hot 100. The single became Davis' highest-charting single to that point and her fourth solo hit. It also became her first single to chart on the Hot 100. In the later months, the song was issued onto Davis' second studio album entitled, Here's the Answer.
1437	"(I Can't Make It) Another Day" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson featuring Lenny Kravitz, released on the posthumous album Michael. Initially leaked as a 90-second snippet, it was referred to as "Another Day". Shortly after the leak, singer-songwriter Lenny Kravitz confirmed that he had produced and composed "Another Day"; he stated that although he did not leak the song, he would like to have the full version of the song—in which he also features—officially released. Kravitz later referred to the song as "(I Can't Make It) Another Day" on Facebook prior to the release of the Michael album. The song was recorded for the album Invincible, but dropped from the final track list. It was later re-written and re-titled "Storm", a collaboration between Kravitz and rapper Jay-Z which is featured on the former's 2004 album Baptism.
1438	In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson died at the age of 50 following cardiac arrest. Three weeks after Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak  there were news reports that there was a "vast vault" and "dozens and dozens" of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. I think we are going to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on."
1439	Gil Kaufman of MTV spoke of the snippet's composition, proclaiming that it had a "thumping R&B beat and soaring strings". She stated that "the tune rides a grinding R&B beat" as Jackson sings in a "plaintive falsetto": "My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars/ And you're the only one that could take me this far/ I'll be forever searching for your love." Kaufman noted that Jackson became more forceful during the chorus, when he sang, "You're the one that makes me strong / I can't make it another day / You're the fire that keeps me warm / I can't make it another day." The journalist also noted the lyrical and melodical similarities between "Another Day" and "Storm", which features Kravitz singing, "I walked away but I was wrong / You're the one that keeps me strong / You're the fire that keeps me warm / How will I get through this storm?"
1440	Following the leak, Kravitz discussed the song in a video he uploaded to the social networking site Twitter. He confirmed that he had written, produced and played instruments on the song, as well as record it with Jackson. Kravitz stated that he was not responsible for the unofficial release, as his copy "has been locked up in a vault". He noted that the two DJs on the snippet were not involved in the recording process, stating, "I don't know what their purpose is, but that person has nothing to do with the track." Kravitz reflected that working with Jackson had been "one of the most amazing musical experiences" that he had ever had. "It was done by two people who had respect for each other and who love music — that was it." The singer-songwriter concluded that "Another Day" had not been mixed or completed but added that he hoped the full song would be released and heard "the way me and Michael intended it to be".
1441	The song received generally positive reviews. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said the song "galvanizes him further", yielding the album (Michael)'s  "most genuinely fierce moment". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe review the song as "a faint echo of vintage rock-oriented Jackson tracks such as Dirty Diana and Beat It"., " Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone also draw a comparasion with this song and Dirty Diana. Jason Lipshutz with Gail Mitchell and Gary Graff from Billboard said the song developed an industrial rock groove that was a bit reminiscent of Nine Inch Nails, "Jackson bellows on the chorus, as guitars envelop his voice and Kravitz repeats the song title like a lullaby,"."
1442	Although Dave Grohl is credited as having played drums on the track "(I Can't Make It) Another Day", Grohl himself claimed in the November 2011 issue of The Red Bulletin that he does not perform on the track. According to Grohl, Lenny Kravitz asked him to play on the song but neither Kravitz nor Michael Jackson contacted him after he had recorded his drums and the version of the song that appears on Michael does not feature his playing. Grohl called the fact that he was credited in the album notes despite not playing on the record "not cool".
1443	On its initial release in December 1960, the U.S. release on the Argo record label was titled "I Don't Know Why". However, about ten weeks later, Argo announced that due to confusion arising from the song being mistaken for the 1931 song called "I Don't Know Why (I Just Do)", they changed the name of this song to "But I Do". The UK release on the Pye label and the Australian release on the Coronet label were both titled "But I Do". The UK version spent 19 weeks in the charts and peaked at No. 3 in the first week of May 1961.
1444	Lyrically, the song was influenced partially by "a late run of '60s films set in London on the BBC" that Costello had been watching at the time. Costello was also inspired by trips he had taken with his father to Chelsea in his youth; Costello explained, "I'd gone with my Dad to a few of the more enduring clothing haunts of Chelsea on a rare outing together. ... Now Chelsea seemed even more of an unattainable neighborhood. It stood for both the groovy past and was reported in the papers as the hot-bed of the new punk ferment".
1445	"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea" was based on what Costello described as a "stop-start chord sequence borrowed from the Who" combined with a "clickerty-clackerty guitar figure off an old Rocksteady record by the Pioneers". In his album notes for Girls Girls Girls, Costello wrote that the song "[m]ight have been just a poor relation to 'All Day and All of the Night', 'I Can't Explain' or even 'Clash City Rockers' had it not been for Bruce Thomas' great bassline. Meanwhile I was trying to fit in this lick from an old Pioneers record, though which one I can't recall." Costello later commented on the song's combination of influences, "[It] has effectively three hooks [Costello's guitar, Bruce Thomas's bass, and Thomas's drums] and you would have struggled to pinpoint where the ideas had originated".
1446	Pete Thomas said of his drum part on the song, "The precedent of some fancy drumming had been set. 'Watching the Detectives' had that drum intro. 'Chelsea' is me saying, 'If Elvis Costello is going to have fancy drum intros, I'm doing one'. It was one of the first few takes. If you really listen to it, I'm trying out stuff all the way through". Costello later claimed that Thomas had lifted the drum intro from Mitch Mitchell's performance on the Jimi Hendrix Experience's song "Fire". Organist Steve Nieve uses a deliberately out of tune Vox Continental organ on the song; Costello described the keyboard sound as "thin" and "evil".  Costello cited the song as an example of This Year's Model's "spiky and sour" sound, which was created through "a solitary box of tricks to delay and detune" the instruments.
1447	"(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea" was released as the debut single from Costello's second album This Year's Model on 3 March 1978. The B-side was "You Belong to Me", another song from This Year's Model. The single was Costello's second chart hit in the UK, peaking at number 16 on the UK Singles Chart over a chart stay of ten weeks. The single reached number 12 in Ireland and number 93 in Australia. The song received glowing critical attention at the time, with the NME concluding, "The single's so good, the very act of releasing it amounts to bragging on a colossal scale". The song was released on This Year's Model on 17 March 1978, though it was omitted on US versions of the album for being too British.
1448	Since its release, "Chelsea" has been praised by music critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the song for being "underscored with sexual menace", while the same site's Tom Maginnis called it a "brilliant ska-inflected rocker". Kit Rachlis of Rolling Stone praised Costello for the "precision" with which he described Chelsea, while Morgan Troper of PopMatters said, "It's almost not worth listening to Model unless it's a version that contains 'Chelsea', as the song's presence is essential to This Year's Model's overall impact". Dave Lifton of Ultimate Classic Rock named the song as the 7th best Elvis Costello song, proclaiming it the "standout" from This Year's Model and calling it "a perfect example of the mixture of chaos and skill [the Attractions] brought". Martin Chilton of the Daily Telegraph named the song Costello's 15th best.
1449	Hank Williams was a Jimmie Davis disciple who scored a big hit on Decca Records with "You Are My Sunshine" in 1939 and "There's a New Moon Over My Shoulder" in 1945.  It is unclear when he and Hank Williams wrote "(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle"; on one of his Mother's Best radio shows, recorded between January and March 1951, Williams tells his audience that he's going fishing with Jimmie Davis the next week, so the song may have been composed then. Containing two of country music's major themes, trains and prison, the song is notable for the way Hank mimics the sound of a train whistle on the word "lonesome." The song was likely an inspiration for Johnny Cash's "Folsom Prison Blues."  It was recorded at Castle Studio in Nashville on July 25, 1951 with Fred Rose producing and backing from Don Helms (steel guitar), Jerry Rivers (fiddle), Sammy Pruett (lead guitar), Howard Watts (bass) and probably Jack Shook (rhythm guitar).
1450	Acuff-Rose songwriter Helen Hudgins later recalled the stiflingly hot summer session: "Hank had his shirt unbuttoned all the way, and he was absolutely soaking wet.  It seemed that all he was...was voice.  It came up from I don't know where." In a June 2014 online Rolling Stone article, Joseph Hudak wrote of the song, "The sound is so stark, so unsettling, that it's easy to feel exactly what Williams was getting at in the performance: simple heartbreak."  The song's title was truncated to "Lonesome Whistle" so that it could be listed on jukebox cards. It peaked at number 8 on the Billboard country singles chart.  The B-side, Fred Rose's "Crazy Heart", outperformed it, peaking at number four.
1451	In early 2020, the song was rerecorded and reissued as in an orchestral incarnation as well as in several other versions as the lead single for the second Cutting Crew compilation album, "Ransomed Healed Restored Forgiven," accompanied by a new music video to have been uploaded on YouTube, through the official account of band's new label, August Day. The new release for the hit has been through an 8-track EP, available since on digital platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. There is also a physical release, in CD, offered as a solo release and also included as part of the limited deluxe version of the new greatest hits album, both sold through the band's official webstore.
1452	"(I Just Want It) To Be Over" is a song by American singer Keyshia Cole. It was written by the singer along with Alicia Keys, Taniesha Smith, and Kerry "Krucial" Brothers for her debut album, The Way It Is (2005). Production on the song was helmed by the latter. Released on April 5, 2005 as the album's second single, "(I Just Want It) To Be Over" became a moderate success on the US Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at number 30.  It also reached number one on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart, which acts as an extension to the Hot 100.
1453	The music video starts with Cole sitting on a bed, singing the first verse. She tries numerous times to escape the room she is locked in. She then breaks a mirror with a chair and steps through the mirror frame. The next scene shows broken glass on the floor. Cole is then seen wearing a sun dress. As she walks down a hall she sees a man and two women in the room; when she approaches the next room she spots a man and a woman arguing. Cole walks into a nightclub in a black tank top and mini skirt, and performs the song with a band. The video ends by showing a montage of the preceding events.
1454	The song, which saw its official release on September 7, 1993, was produced by Def Jef and Meech Wells and featured a guest verse from Def Jef as well. "(I Know I Got) Skillz" was a success, peaking at 35 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming Shaq's only solo top-40 hit in the US, although he managed to avoid one hit wonder status as he previously scored a hit as a featured guest on the Fu-Schnickens hit "What's Up Doc? (Can We Rock)". The single was certified gold by the RIAA on December 21, 1993, for shipping of 500,000 copies.
1455	"(I Like) The Way You Love Me" is a song by American recording artist Michael Jackson included on his posthumous album Michael, which was released in South Korea as a digital single on January 18, 2011, and released in Italian radio stations on July 8, 2011. The song previously appeared on The Ultimate Collection (2004) with the title "The Way You Love Me" as an unreleased track, with that version also appearing on the French edition of the compilation King of Pop. Shortly before Jackson’s death, the song was re-arranged and more vocals were added. A clip of the song was remixed and released on the 2 disc deluxe edition of the Immortal album on November 21, 2011.
1456	The song, along with several demos from the Invincible sessions, was rearranged in 2008. The new arrangement was produced by Theron "Neff-U" Feemster, as he mentioned, "Michael would express to me the importance of giving the world a gift. Giving them songs that would last forever. This song was released in its early stages of development. He wanted to revisit, nurture, and define the song more because MJ was a perfectionist at everything and nothing is ever done until he is smiling and dancing! It was like watching a flower grow and blossom in the spring."
1457	The song received generally positive reviews from music critics. Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called it a "sweet-toned swoon". Joe Vogel of The Huffington Post stated that the song was a "great new production by Neff-U", and "the new version retains all of the charm of the original while injecting some fresh elements, including new piano, bass, strings, and vocal effects." Jason Lipshutz, Gail Mitchell and Gary Graff from Billboard thought the song is "the simple sketch eventually led to this blissful love song with its layered vocals and gentle percussion". Michael Roffman of Consequence of Sound praised the track's "incredibly rich instrumentation" and called it "probably the greatest highlight of the album" and "one that felt the most natural, too."Kitty Empire in The Observer said this song was "a breezy bit of froth on which Jackson sounds genuinely carefree".  Joe Pareles of the New York Times noted that the new instrumentation compared to the 2004 mix made the "creamy vocal harmonies even more reminiscent of the Beach Boys." Pareles also questioned whether the ending vocals of the song were digitally altered from the original chorus but stated that he preferred the new version, describing it as more "transparent and uncluttered, a little more lighthearted." 
1458	Group leader George Clinton later produced covers of both "(I Wanna) Testify" and its B-side "I Can Feel The Ice Melting". The former appeared on the 1974 Parliament album Up For The Down Stroke under the abbreviated title "Testify". Both "(I Wanna) Testify" and "I Can Feel The Ice Melting" were re-done by Otis Day and the Knights in 1989 (produced by George Clinton). Another P-Funk spin-off act, the Brides Of Funkenstein recorded a version of "I Can Feel The Ice Melting" in 1978, but the track wasn't released until the 1993 archival release "A Fifth Of Funk". That recording was produced by P-Funk production assistant Ron Dunbar.
1459	The track was produced by Damon Rochefort, who also shares writing credits with fellow Nomad member Steve McCutcheon and rapper MC Mikee Freedom. It also quotes from the earlier club hit "Devotion" by Ten City. Although Freedom and singer Sharon Dee Clarke were the featured artists on this track when it was released in the United Kingdom and other territories (even though Freedom was the only one to get his name credited), they were listed as uncredited in the US single version up until the act's full-length CD Changing Cabins was released Stateside in the autumn of 1991. Both artists were featured in the video for the track, which had them dressed in body paint while they were performing the song at a rave concert.
1460	AllMusic editor Stewart Mason described the song as a "terrific dance club staple" and noted further that singer Sharon Dee Clarke has a "soulful, expressive voice", and writer/programmer Damon Rochefort gives the whole thing a "perky, bouncy feel". David Taylor-Wilson from Bay Area Reporter said it is "extremely enticing", complimenting Clarke's vocals as "superb". American magazine Billboard stated that the song recently topped dance charts "thanks to Sharon Dee Clark's belting vocals and Damon Rochefort's savvy beat and melody construction." Larry Flick complimented its "contagious melody, a slammin' groove, and a well-timed trade-off between rapid malerapping and diva-styled femme singing." Pop Rescue wrote that "it's audience cheers as Sharon declares that she wants 'to give you devotion' before that familiar bassy synth follows and she lets out that unmistakeable 'heeee-eee-hooo-oooo' piece. Rapper MC Mikee Freedom joins in, in what is a great example of early 1990s chart rap – somewhat slower and devoid of the sexual violence that you'd expect in most rap now." Johnny Dee from Smash Hits noted the track as "utterlly brill".
1461	"(I Wanna Give You) Devotion" went on becoming a major hit on the charts in Europe, peaking at number-one in Greece. In the United Kingdom, it reached number 2 in its seventh week at the UK Singles Chart, on February 17, 1991. The song was held off the top spot by The Simpsons' "Do the Bartman". It managed to climb into the Top 10 also in Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, as well as on the Eurochart Hot 100, where it hit number 6. Outside Europe, "(I Wanna Give You) Devotion" peaked at number-one on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play in the US, number 3 on the RPM Dance/Urban Chart in Canada and number 37 in Australia. It earned a silver record in the UK, with a sale of 200,000 singles.
1462	An early cut of Everybody's Fine was screened for McCartney, with Aretha Franklin's cover of "Let It Be" inserted as a place holder by director Kirk Jones. McCartney was inspired to write the song for the film after connecting with the protagonist, portrayed by Robert De Niro, a widower who "hits the road to visit his scattered children after they cancel a weekend gathering." McCartney told USA Today, "I can very much relate to a guy who's got older children, who happens to have lost his wife, the mother of those children, and is trying to get them all together at Christmas. I understand that." After recording a demo version on cassette, McCartney received notes for the song from Jones requesting an intro for the song as opposed to its original "abrupt" start. McCartney then collaborated with the film's music composer Dario Marianelli on orchestrations for the song "resulting in an intimate ballad with piano, guitar and spare strings." "(I Want to) Come Home" was recorded with engineer Geoff Emerick along with 20 other tracks around this time.
1463	"(I Would) Die for You" is a song released by Antique. It was the Greek entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2001, performed in English and Greek (the first Greek entry not to be performed entirely in Greek) by Antique, a duo consisting of Elena Paparizou and Nikos Panagiotidis, both born and raised in Sweden by Greek parents. Prior to entering the Contest the group had had two Top 10 hits in both Greece and Sweden, "Opa Opa" and "Dinata Dinata".  "(I Would) Die for You" was released as a CD single by Bonnier Music and EMI International following the contest. The CD single was certified platinum in Greece and gold in Sweden. The song was included on Antique's second album, Die for You, released as Die for You/Tha Pethaina Gia Sena in the Greek market.
1464	In 1972–73, The Faces recorded the song as an outtake for Ooh La La (1973), their final studio album. In 1974, Millie Jackson released her version of the song which received two Grammy Award nominations. In 1978, Barbara Mandrell's version topped the U.S. country chart, reached number 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 (number 27 Cashbox), and was nominated for Single of the Year at the 1979 CMA (Country Music Association) Awards. Rod Stewart recorded the song for Foot Loose & Fancy Free (1977), his eighth album; as a single it peaked at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart in 1980.
1465	Millie Jackson, however, took a somewhat different approach. On both studio and live recordings, her version is typically divided into three parts: "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right", "The Rap", and "(If Loving You Is Wrong) I Don't Want to Be Right (Reprise)", which together have a running time of over 11 minutes. The first and third parts include the song more or less as originally written, while the second part was written by Jackson herself. Titled "The Rap", the middle segment is a monologue in which an unrepentant Jackson discusses her status as the "other woman" and why she loves it.
1466	It was first recorded by The Emotions but their version has never been released and by Veda Brown, whose version was finally released in 2008.  Other notable singers to cover it include: country singer Jackie Burns (whose version made Hot Country Songs in 1972), Isaac Hayes, Millie Jackson, Rod Stewart, Percy Sledge, Bobby "Blue" Bland, David Ruffin, Barbara Mason, LeAnn Rimes, Renée Geyer, Ramsey Lewis, jazz chanteuse Della Reese, reggae singers Alton Ellis, George Faith and Glen Washington, Tom Jones, Cassandra Wilson, Nathan Cavaleri, Rania Zeriri, Barbara Mandrell and Johanne Desforges (French cover : Si je ne peux t'aimer a quoi bon exister).
1467	The song was translated into English by Jack Fishman. When it was offered to The Tremeloes as a potential single, they rejected it. Dave Clark 5 also wanted to record it and they did record the song. It was also recorded by Amen Corner as their debut single for their new record label, Immediate Records, and was produced by Shel Talmy. The most successful of the band's six hit singles, it reached number one on the UK Singles Chart for two weeks in February 1969, and number 34 when it was reissued in 1976.There are two differing versions of the song by Amen Corner; one with orchestra and a prominent horn through the middle eight, and one version without either. However, the basic track and vocals appear the same in both.
1468	One year later on 18 March 1991, "(If There Was) Any Other Way" was released as the second single in the United States after "Where Does My Heart Beat Now". For the US market the single was remixed by Walter Afanasieff. This US version features a different audio mix from the Canadian single version and the album version: reverb has been applied throughout (most noticeably to Dion's vocal track), the guitars have been rebalanced so that they are less audible in some places in the song and more prominent in others, the drum track features "rimshot" effects during the chorus, additional synthesizer lines have been overdubbed onto the existing keyboard track (most noticeably in the bar before the instrumental break), and the fadeout has been slightly extended in length. It was also used in the American music video of the song that year. Additionally "(If There Was) Any Other Way" was remixed by Daniel Abraham, a French record producer living in New York. His dance remixes appeared on a promotional US single.
1469	AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine picked the song as an album standout along with "Where Does My Heart Beat Now". Larry Flick from Billboard noted that Dion "continues to soar" with a "spirited, up-tempo" song. He complimented the "crystalline production and shimmering backup vocal support combined with a passionate lead performance". Dave Sholin from the Gavin Report wrote about the song: "Nothing like witnessing the growth and development of a genuine artist. Celine definitely falls into that category, capturing the hearts of Americans the way she's been doing in her native Canada for the past several years. Switching from torch song to snappy rhythm affords listeners an opportunity to hear another side of this wonderful talent". Music & Media noted that "talented Canadian chanteuse enters the Whitney Houston racket" and described it as "satisfying AC pop." Christopher Smith from TalkAboutPopMusic described it as a "pop-soft rock mid tempo number".
1470	In Canada "(If There Was) Any Other Way" entered the RPM Top Singles chart on 31 March 1990 and peaked at number twenty-three on 9 June 1990. The song also entered the RPM Adult Contemporary chart on 24 March 1990 and reached number twelve there. In the United States "(If There Was) Any Other Way" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, dated 6 April 1991, and peaked at number thirty-five on 1 June 1991. The track also entered Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart dated 30 March 1991, reaching number eight.
1471	"(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" is a song co-written and recorded by Canadian country music singer Shania Twain.  It was released in November 1995 as the fourth single from her album The Woman in Me.  The song was written by Mutt Lange and Twain.  The song became Twain's second number-one hit at country radio, and the first single to be promoted with three different mixes worldwide to cater to international genre demand.  It spent two weeks at the top of the chart in February 1996.  The song was also her breakthrough hit in Australia. "(If You're Not in It for Love) I'm Outta Here!" was later included on Twain's 2004 Greatest Hits package, and has been performed on all of her tours. In 1997, the eurodance group Real McCoy covered "I'm Outta Here!".
1472	The video begins with a shot of Twain standing behind a blue light in front of a man sitting on a chair. She walks up to the man, who stands up and flips over his chair, meanwhile, the video cuts to a slow-motion shot of people dancing in a club and a shot of Twain walking up to a microphone in front of her and surrounded by many people playing drums. It cuts back to Twain trying to sit on the chair, when the man kicks it away for her to fall on the floor. But the next shot of them is them laughing and pushing away as people start to come over. In the subsequent shots, intercut with shots of Twain performing alone without the drums, Twain and several others drumming near a window, and Twain on a balcony, friends grab the microphone off of Twain and engage in a karaoke session with her, male stereotypes try to turn on Twain near the microphone, Twain teaches people a dance routine, people play air guitar with fake guitars, and Twain plays along to the drummers. In the final shot, Twain walks out of the building alone.
1473	During Shania's Come On Over Tour and Up! Tour, the song was performed as the last main song of the setlist before returning to the stage for her encores. Each of the cities Twain visited on both tours, she would invite a local school Marching Band drum line to join her on stage. Twain would also play the drums along as well on stage. At the end of the song on the Come On Over Tour, Twain leads the drummers into a drum roll, which leads into a grand finale, including Twain standing on top of a big drum, while an electric lap steel guitar solo plays, before disappearing into it as fireworks and confetti erupt from the stage. On the Up! Tour, she again leads the drummers in joining in a big drum roll which lets off the fireworks with Twain disappearing after the song ends.  The song has also been performed during her Vegas residency and her Rock This Country tour as the last song before the encore.
1474	"I'm Outta Here!" debuted at number 69 on the US Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart the week of November 18, 1995. It spent 20 weeks on the chart and peaked at number one on February 3, 1996, where it remained for two weeks. This would give Twain her second number-one single, second Top 10 single, and fourth consecutive Top 20 single. The song also topped the Country Singles Sales chart for one week. "I'm Outta Here!" was Twain's second single on the Billboard Hot 100, where it bowed at number 74; it reached number 43 in sales.
1475	"(If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To" is a song by American alternative rock/power pop band Weezer. It was released as the first single from the band's seventh studio album Raditude. Initially scheduled to be released to American rock radio on August 25, 2009, the official release of the single to radio was moved up to August 18. The single debuted at number 21 on the Billboard Rock Songs Chart, and in the same position on the Alternative Songs chart.  The music video features Odette Yustman. The song was first played live on August 23, 2009 in Toronto, Ontario at the Molson Amphitheatre. The main riff of this song bears a similarity to the main riff of The Jam song "Town Called Malice".
1476	On the week ending September 12, 2009, (If You're Wondering If I Want You To) I Want You To" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 82. It fell off the following week, but on the week ending November 21, 2009 (the same week that their album Raditude debuted at number 7 on the Billboard 200), it re-entered at number 81. On the Alternative Rock Chart, it peaked at number 2 in its eighth week and stayed there for 12 consecutive weeks behind Muse's "Uprising". It is Weezer's longest charting song on the Billboard Alternative Rock Chart to date.
1477	The two flanking side rooms remained empty apart from a solitary lectern painted in the same color as the chairs and which was connected to speakers that emitted music and sounds composed by participating sound artists Andy Cox and Richard Allalouf, Natalia Kamia, Samon Takahashi, Ebbot Lundberg and Yan Jun who interpreted a text written by Hüttner and Arnér on the importance and difficulty of dialogues between art and science. A new sound piece was played back each week. Lundberg's contribution, There's Only One of Us Here was released in 2012 – his first solo album in a 25-year career.
1478	In 2008, the band gave fans the opportunity to hear numerous demos from the album through their MySpace blog whilst they were recording. After previously releasing their albums through major record labels, the band decided to release independently. They moved from Festival Mushroom to release their first album on Roadrunner Records (Australia). It was recorded at multiple locations, including a country house in Victoria, Gumstead, Sing Sing Studios, Pete's Ranch, 301 and Paradise. "Break Me" was the first song released, made available through the band's website for free download in 2008. The band opted to not release the song through traditional methods. The first single from the album was "Digital Age", which was released to the iTunes Store on 12 June 2009. A limited edition was released through JB Hi-Fi featuring two bonus tracks: "All Together Now" and "Home".
1479	Ellington reported that he composed it in a recording studio in 20 minutes, as his orchestra had arrived with three pieces to record and required another. It is in D♭ major and has an AABA form (although "the IV chord in measure 3 is replaced by a II7 the second time"). According to Ellington, the title was suggested by trumpeter Arthur Whetsel. An AllMusic writer describes the composition as "at once optimistic in its tone but somber in its pace, conflicted with the emotions of bitter loneliness and fond remembrance". The mood is set "in the very first phrase of the melody, with its ascent to the leading tone of the scale falling just short of the tonic, and in the seemingly unremarkable chord progressions that nevertheless manage to transform harmonic resolution into wistful resignation".
1480	The first recording of the song was by Ellington on January 10, 1934. His second version, from September of the same year, reached No. 2 on the charts in 1935. The Mills Blue Rhythm Band's rendition reached No. 8 that year. "Solitude" was recorded at least 28 times between 1934 and 1942. Vocalist Billie Holiday recorded the song several times in the 1940s and 1950s, "with the world-weariness of the words matching to an almost disturbing degree her late-career persona". One of her renditions was added to the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2021. Writing in 2012, Ted Gioia commented that "For the most part, 'Solitude' serves as a tribute piece nowadays, often played in an overly respectful manner that captures more the sound than the spirit of [Ellington]".
1481	Written by two Americans with a strong country-western lyrical theme, the song was first released in Europe, where it has become much more popular than in the composers' native country, with a big-band/orchestral pop arrangement sung by Tony Christie. Christie's version was a major hit in Europe and a modest success in his native United Kingdom upon its release, then became even more popular in the mid-2000s when the song was reissued. As Christie's version failed to make a major impact in the U.S., Sedaka released his own recording of the song in 1977, which narrowly missed the top 40 but was an easy listening hit in the U.S. and Canada.
1482	The song was recorded by Tony Christie and released in the UK in November 1971, initially reaching number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. However, it was a substantially bigger hit at that time across Continental Europe, notably in Germany and Spain, where it made number one. In the U.S., however, Christie's record stalled at #121 on the Bubbling Under the Hot 100. Following the re-issue of Christie's version in 2005 in aid of the charity Comic Relief, promoted with a video featuring comedian Peter Kay, the song gained even greater prominence, reaching number 1 in the UK.
1483	In the first few cameos, Max and Paddy from Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights and its spin-off appear together, arguing and eventually fighting in the Granada studios' corridor. This is one of many appearances of characters from Kay's TV series, including Paddy's tennis playing cell mate Cliff from Max and Paddy's Road to Nowhere, and both a football team for people with dwarfism and Brian Potter from Phoenix Nights. The video consists almost entirely of Kay walking towards the camera flanked by different pairings of the celebrities, in front of increasingly bizarre and unlikely backgrounds.
1484	From 2012 onwards any repeat airing of the music video on television is now a re-edited version which takes out the appearance of Savile. In October 2012, a series of revelations showed Savile to be a prolific repeated child sex offender, thus his appearance in the video which helped raise funds for disadvantaged children in Africa and the UK was edited out for future broadcasts. The re-edited version is mainly the same as the original except the short 15-second scene with Savile who joined Peter Kay and actress Sally Lindsay is now re-edited to show Sally and Kay only, with a slowed down and repeated showing of Sally on her own next to Kay to fill the gap left by the absence of Savile, thus eliminating Savile from the 15-second section. The original version remains on YouTube.
1485	Is This the Way to Armadillo is a spoof video of the song "Is This the Way to Amarillo" produced by the Royal Dragoon Guards stationed in Iraq at Al-Faw towards the end of their 6-month deployment there. The video was emailed so frequently on 13 May 2005 it crashed a server at the Ministry of Defence. According to the Evening Standard, the crashing of the server caused systems to go down at various British military establishments, and the MoD was forced to issue instructions to delete all instances of the video.
1486	Dutch singer Albert West covered the song in 1988. After the successful re-release of the song in the UK, Tony Christie re-recorded it with the Hermes House Band; this version charted in Germany in 2005. There is also a version by the Les Humphries Singers and a version in German by Roberto Blanco. There is also a 1971 version on the MGM label (K 14360) by a band called English House, produced by Terry Slater. The A-side was "Music Is the Voice of Love" composed by Terry Slater and Phil Everly. The song has also been covered in Czech as "Kvítek mandragory" by Helena Vondráčková and as "Napis Na Dverich" by Jiri Hromadka. The Finnish version, "Amarillo", with lyrics by Pertti Reponen, was first recorded by Johnny Liebkind in 1972, then by Kari Tapio in 1979 and most recently by Danny (Ilkka Lipsanen) in 1987; the latter made the song a staple of Finnish pop music. Other artists to have recorded the song include Daniel O'Donnell and James Last.
1487	In 2005, Christie had a hit with a Comic Relief re-release of "Amarillo" with Peter Kay that reached number 1 on the UK singles charts for 7 weeks in a row. The BBC Three Counties Radio presenters Ian Stringer and George Webley wrote alternate lyrics to Amarillo to support England at the World Cup, which the song predicts England will win. Christie was convinced to record the song using those lyrics by the BBC Radio 1 presenter Chris Moyles. The music video for it was filmed at Barnet F.C.'s Underhill Stadium in London. Christie initially said about it: "It's got a nice summery feel about it and people seem to like it" and the BBC commissioned him to review other 2006 World Cup songs competing with him. The Manchester Evening News said about "Is This the Way to The World Cup" that: "It's that cheesy, it's a classic". Like with "Amarillo" the year before, the profits for the single went to charity, specifically SportsAid.
1488	"(It's Just) The Way That You Love Me" is a song recorded by American singer Paula Abdul for her debut album Forever Your Girl (1988). Written and produced solely by producer Oliver Leiber, the song was originally released in its remix form as the second single from the album on August 2, 1988 by Virgin to minor success in the States. Following the breakthrough success of her next three singles, the song was re-released on September 15, 1989 under its original version to commercial success, becoming Abdul's fourth consecutive top three entry on the Billboard Hot 100 and to date, tying with "Straight Up" as her longest charting performance on the chart. The song, however, did not replicate the same success in the UK where it managed to peak at number seventy-four on the UK Singles Chart, thus becoming her lowest charting single in the region to date.
1489	In June 1988, Forever Your Girl was released, along with the follow-up single "The Way That You Love Me". Virgin and Abdul's producers felt that it was necessary to remix the song for its single release, hence the addition of (It's Just) to the song's title; also, Karyn White's "The Way You Love Me" was out at this time, thus helping to avoid confusion among consumers. The song failed to attract much attention, despite its dance-pop remix. The song stalled at #88 on the Billboard Hot 100 but reached the top 10 of Billboard's R&B chart.
1490	The single was enthusiastically received by BBC Wales' James McLaren, who stated "Well I like it, I really do. It's got a theatrical pop verve to it. A sweeping string-laden hook, classic Bradders growly verse and a widdly solo in the middle eight. The melody is simple but delivered with classic Manics panache." This Is Fake DIY described it: "It's simple, it's catchy and it's enjoyable, and will have many casual radio listeners rifling through their back catalogue to discover what they've been missing all these years." The NME commented that it had "nostalgia...but also an unmistakable sense of vitality and urgency". In an early review of the album, the NME described the track as "quite literally the daftest, campest, most outlandish stadium pop song the Manics have ever put their minds to. But in a really excellent way, with one of those choruses you only need to hear once to remember forever." The Fly called it a "brilliant start" to the album, saying that it "sets out its grandiose stall from the off as James Dean Bradfield's FM-friendly riff gives way to a warm orchestral flourish".
1491	[Jo]Style was one of 14 directors invited to compete in the 3rd D-1 Climax Awards competition sponsored by the Dogma studio in 2007. His entry was the S&M video Egoistic Love - Blind Woman's Desire To Be Humiliated (Egoistic Love 被虐願望、美しき盲目の女) (D1-309) co-starring Azusa Ito and Nana Saeki. He had also directed a number of videos for Moodyz over the years and at the 2008 Moodyz Awards ceremony, he received the 4th Place Award for Best Director. For the 2008 AV Grand Prix competition he directed the 3-hour video MADONNA BOOTCAMP ELITE [AVGL-025], the nominated entry of the Madonna studio.
1492	Ed Wingate, owner of the newly formed Detroit-based Golden World Records, had signed the Reflections on the basis of the group's regional success with the single "You Said Goodbye" on the local Kay-Ko label. Songwriter Freddie Gorman, who had been recruited by Golden World from Motown, would recall that he considered his recent composition "(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet" as "tailor made" for the doo-wop-styled Reflections "because it had a pop feel, as opposed to the R&B thing they were doing." However Reflections' lead singer Tony Micale recalls that none of the group responded positively to the song when Gorman first sang it for them: "It just didn't sound like much with [Gorman] just playing a little piano backup".
1493	The Reflections recorded the vocal for the track several weeks later at the RCA recording studio in Chicago. According to Micale, the group's members still regarded the song as somewhat of a joke. While running through the song prior to the recording session they ad-libbed a falsetto "doo-doo-doot" hook line as irreverent mimicry of Gorman's vocal style when he'd pitched them the song. The group was surprised when Gorman added that line to the song's vocal arrangement. The instrumental track for "(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet" had been recorded at United Sound Systems in Detroit. Micale would recall that when the group's members first heard that instrumental track through the [RCA] studio monitors "we were just blown away... Some of the Motown [session musicians] were playing on it, and the sound was just amazing. Besides our vocals, the only thing added at that point were [the] 'doo-doo-doot's that we had come up with, and hand claps".
1494	"(Just Like) Starting Over" was the first single released from Double Fantasy and the first new recording Lennon had released since he left the music industry in 1975. It was chosen by Lennon not because he felt it was the best track on the album, but because it was the most appropriate following his five-year absence from the recording industry. He referred to it during production as the "Elvis/Orbison" track, as he "tongue in cheek" impersonated their vocal styles; at the start of the 2010 "Stripped Down" version of the song, Lennon says "this one's for Gene, and Eddie, and Elvis... and Buddy."
1495	Although its origins were in unfinished demo compositions like "Don't Be Crazy" and "My Life", it was one of the last songs to be completed in time for the Double Fantasy sessions. "We didn't hear it until the last day of rehearsal," producer Jack Douglas said in 2005. Lennon finished the song while on holiday in Bermuda, and recorded it at The Hit Factory in New York City just weeks later. The song was originally titled "Starting Over"; however, "(Just Like)" was added prior to its release because of its similarity to Dolly Parton's "Starting Over Again" which had topped the Country Charts earlier in the year.
1496	The song is Lennon's biggest solo hit in the United States, staying at number 1 for five weeks. Before Lennon was shot in New York City on 8 December 1980, the single had reached number 8 on the US charts. It reached number 1 for the week ending 27 December. Billboard ranked it at the No. 4 song for 1981. In the UK it had peaked at number 8 in the charts and had fallen to position number 21 before Lennon's death propelled it to number 1. It was overtaken to the Christmas Number One Single rank by the St Winifred's School Choir's "There's No One Quite Like Grandma," finishing at number 2 on that list. The song also reached number 1 on the Cashbox Top 100. By 6 January 1981, there were three Lennon songs in the UK top 5, a feat that remained unequalled for 35 years when Justin Bieber managed to accomplish this in January 2016.
1497	The single was released in the UK on 11 April 1983 as a non-album single, and went to number 2 in the UK Singles Chart.  It was incorporated into the band's EP Fascination!. Released in the US a month after the UK release, the single reached number 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart (their first single to do so) and number 8 on the US Billboard Hot 100 that summer. The EP Fascination!  contained two versions of "(Keep Feeling) Fascination"; the extended mix and an improvisation, both different from the single version. These were also the tracks featured on the 12" issue in the UK.
1498	The video for "(Keep Feeling) Fascination" was filmed in a semi-derelict area of Newham, London which was due for demolition and redevelopment as part of the widescale redevelopment of Docklands and East London which took place in the early 1980s. The video begins with an aerial view of an orange "you are here" dot on a street map, which is revealed as an actual giant orange dot on the ground as the camera zooms in. The dot highlights a single house on the apex of two streets, and the camera passes through a set of window curtains to show the band playing the song inside. The entire room is painted grey, as are the band's instruments and microphones. During the song's bridge, two boys are shown kicking a ball around in the street outside. Both the ball and one boy's clothes turn orange when they enter the dot; when he kicks the ball back, it returns to its original colour. As the song ends, the camera retreats from the room and zooms back out into the sky, the view changing back to the original map.
1499	Both the house (which was 1 First Avenue, London E13 8AP) and surrounding area (Junction of 1st Avenue and 3rd Avenue) encompassed by the orange dot were completely painted orange, including a nearby Austin 1800 car. The video was conceived and directed by Steve Barron, who directed most of the Human League's early 1980s music videos. The band's scenes were all filmed in a studio; Susan Ann Sulley says that the house was still occupied by a family during the painting and filming of the external scenes. The house remained orange until being demolished in mid-1983.
1500	Gloriana member Tom Gossin co-wrote the song with Josh Kear, who also wrote the band's debut single "Wild at Heart". Gossin based the duet around a conversation between two girls that he overheard at a restaurant. After one of them said, "Girl, that is his job to make the first move!", Gossin said, "My ears perk up, and I was listening because I wanted to know what they had to say about it. They were like, ‘It is always the guy’s job. Just push her up against the wall and do it!’ That became like the first [idea] that I had when I wrote with Josh."
1501	"(Last Night) I Didn't Get to Sleep at All" is a song written by Tony Macaulay and performed by The 5th Dimension with instrumental backing from L.A. session musicians from the Wrecking Crew. In the United States, the song reached #2 on the adult contemporary chart, #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and #28 on the R&B chart in 1972. The song appeared on the band's album Individually and Collectively, produced by Bones Howe and arranged by Bill Holman. It became the group's fifth and final platinum record. In Canada, it spent a week at #6 on the RPM 100 in July 1972.
1502	Tony Macaulay began work on the song while in Tokyo for the World Popular Song Festival of 1972. He met fellow attendees the Carpenters and was inspired to write a song emulating their hit "We've Only Just Begun" (Macaulay: "I liked the feel of that, the shuffle feel of it"). Macaulay recalls that due to changing time zones "I was awake all night and sleeping all day [in Tokyo]. So I just got up in the night and I wrote it". Although he was having sleepless nights in Tokyo, it was the melody rather than the lyrics that he wrote there. The lyrics were completed after Macaulay's return to London "in a taxi stuck in a traffic jam ... in about an hour going from one side of London to another".
1503	Macaulay sent a demo of the song to the Carpenters. "They said they loved it and they'd do it. [Later] I got a phone call about 2 o'clock in the morning that woke me up (they hadn't figured out the time change between here and America). They said 'Oh, we can't record it because it mentions sleeping pills and they are drugs and we don't mention drugs.' So I got up in the middle of the night and rewrote the last verse without the sleeping pills." However, Macaulay was not happy with the change to the lyric, so when Bones Howe contacted him the next week, Macaulay pitched "(Last Night)..." for the 5th Dimension, who recorded it with the sleeping pill reference intact.
1504	Hank Williams recorded "(Last Night) I Heard You Crying in Your Sleep" at his first MGM recording session after releasing a few sides with Sterling Records.  Despite its bouncy tempo, the song contains somber lyrics about a heartbroken man who has come to realize that the woman he loves has never loved him.  Making the song even sadder is the forgiving tone of the narrator ("I know you tried your best to love me," "I love you so much I want you happy"), and its simple language is as good an illustration as any of the profound simplicity of Williams' love songs.  An embryonic version of the song exists as a lyric sheet in the Alabama Department of Archives and History with words quite dissimilar to the finished recording, suggesting that songwriting wasn't quite the spontaneous act that Williams later made it out to be in interviews; in 1952 he declared to Pathfinder, "People don't write music. It's given to you; you sit there and wait and it comes to you.  If a song takes longer than thirty minutes or an hour, I usually throw it away.
1505	A music video for the song was released in February 1994. It featured the group members, along with several supporting actors, appearing nude. Members of the video crew were reported to have "giggled a lot" during the 14-hour shoot. It was reshot after BET, MTV, and other cable outlets requested them to minimize the nudity for airplay. D'wayne Wiggins explained the concept as their response to criticism of male artists for sexually objectifying women in music videos, calling their video "sort of a role-reversal thing". He said in an interview for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he received the most "giggles ... because I went first, which I had to do because I was the one leading everybody on to do it nude. It's not like it's nudity just for nudity's sake, but we didn't want to do another la-de-da video. It's like 14 or 15 people are together in a room and different people are shown without clothes at different times."
1506	(Le) Poisson Rouge (often referred to as LPR) is a music venue and multimedia art cabaret in New York City founded in 2008 by Justin Kantor and David Handler on the former site of the Village Gate at 158 Bleecker Street. The performance space was designed and engineered by John Storyk/WSDG. It has become known for its focus on artistry, bringing contemporary classical music into the club setting, and offering a variety of set ups so that a seated classical performance can be followed by a standing set by a rock band or a DJ. Responding to a performance of Olivier Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time featuring pianist Bruce Brubaker at LPR, The Wall Street Journal reported: "The crowd – many of whom wouldn't even have known who Messiaen was – sat in rapt silence, and roared their approval at the end."
1507	Although this is the only single credited to the group, it was actually their second single; their previous single "Too Hurt to Cry, Too Much in Love to Say Goodbye" was credited to "the Darnells". The Andantes, as one of the label's main session groups, sang background vocals for numerous Motown acts, and used to "sweeten" the sound of others. The group was apparently promised by the company that they would be allowed to record a few singles, but this single was the only one credited to the group. Furthermore, the group was not even allowed to front either side of either single. Former Challengers III lead, and future Marvelette, Ann Bogan leads both sides of this single. (Marvelette Gladys Horton, whom Bogan later replaced, was main lead on the previous single's A-side; Lamont Dozier, of Holland–Dozier–Holland, lead its B-side.) Motown did little to promote the single and it was quickly withdrawn, and thus did not chart. The group would continue to back the labels acts in the studio until the labels move to Los Angeles in 1972.
1508	In the first quarter of 2008, (Lil) Green Patch users raised over $15,000 in donations, which was enough to save more than 13,600,000 square feet (1.26 km2) of rainforest. The application was then among the 15 most popular Facebook applications, with 350,000 active users. In June 2008, it was one of the top ten most installed applications, with more than 5,217,180 installations and 521,718 active users a day. By October 2008, the app had raised $91,000 for The Nature Conservancy. By December 2008, the number of users was reported at 6.3 million, and the application was ranked as one of the five most popular Facebook applications. The area of Costa Rican rainforest that had been saved at that time was up to 70 million square feet.
1509	"(Loneliness Made Me Realize) It's You That I Need" is a 1963 song that became a 1967 hit single recorded by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label, produced and co-written by Norman Whitfield. This is one of the small handful of pre-psychedelic era songs the group recorded that had more than two members singing lead at one point, and the only one that charted. It peaked on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop charts in the Top 20 at number 14, and in the Billboard R&B charts at number 3.
1510	Issued with the Otis Williams-led "Don't Send Me Away" as its B-side, "It's You That I Need" was the fourth and final single from the group's 1967 album The Temptations with a Lot o' Soul. The single would be the last one with all group members singing lead until "Cloud Nine". It would also be the last single in which lyricist Eddie Holland would be teamed with Norman Whitfield, who would now be partnered with Barrett Strong for the next five years creating the group's material. Holland, who originally recorded the song (for the Motown label) as an unreleased track back in 1963, was also a member of the production team of H-D-H, who had become dissatisfied with both their pay and the working atmosphere at Motown, and the trio left the label in early 1968.
1511	Upon release, Paul Phillips of National RockStar magazine reviewed Love's a Prima Donna and highlighted "(Love) Compared with You" and "Carry Me Again" as "two tracks which work, not because they are simple songs, but because they are simply presented". Geoff Barton of Sounds described the song as "balladic" and highlighted the "lovely line "Like a waterfall you tingle me with your love"". He added: "This one comes across extremely well, building into an all-encompassing entity and ending with the tear-jerking lines "I love you - I'm in love with you" echoing away into the distance". American magazine Billboard listed the album under the "Pop" section of their "Recommended LPs". The review highlighted the song, along with the title track, as the album's best cuts. In a 1976 issue of the EMI Records Weekly News magazine Music Talk, Rex Anderson compared the song with the title track: ""(Love) Compared with You" is the first real highpoint of the album and possibly one of the best things Steve has written to date. It contrasts with all his other work in that it is romantic and dreamy. It is a love hymn with beautifully gentle acoustic guitar, piano, and strings. Later in the review, Anderson also praised Tony Rivers for his vocal arrangements on the song and title track.
1512	In 2020, Harley released a new recording of the song as the opening track on his sixth solo studio album Uncovered. This version, re-titled "Compared with You (Your Eyes Don't Seem to Age)", features a newly-written third verse, replacing the original's repeat of the first verse. Harley revealed to BBC Radio 2's Johnnie Walker in 2020: "I've sung the song [live] many hundreds of times since 1976 [and] every time I'm thinking 'Why are you repeating [the first] verse? Why didn't you write a third verse? Were you lazy? Were you out of words?' 45 years later and I thought the song deserved an update."
1513	I did one song with Barry, 'Thicker Than Water' which I thought was good", Gibb explains, "Even though it says on the credits 'B. & A. Gibb', it is really Barry's song - it is very hard to write with Barry, but he said, 'Help me think of a great title'. That was a period where Barry was thinking of titles first and seeing how they would inspire him to write a song. I said, 'How about Thicker Than Water?' I did not say 'Love Is' just 'Thicker Than Water', he said 'That's great!' and then he came up with 'Love is higher than a mountain' and he just went on from there, but the title was totally my idea.
1514	As evidence of the Gibb brothers' U.S. chart domination in 1978, atop the March 4, 1978 Hot 100 the Bee Gees' "Stayin' Alive" was displaced by this song, which in turn was displaced two weeks later by the Bee Gees' "Night Fever", which in turn was displaced eight weeks later by Yvonne Elliman's "If I Can't Have You".  Since Barry Gibb had a hand in writing all four of these songs, he became the only person in history to write four consecutive US number-one singles, a feat unmatched to this day.  The song was released in February 1978 in Netherlands.
1515	(Là) où je pars is the first solo album recorded by French singer Emmanuel Moire. It was first released on 13 November 2006, then on 21 May 2007 in its second version. Four tracks from the album were released as singles – "Le Sourire", "Ça me fait du bien", "Là où je pars" and "Si c'était ça la vie", but they were only available digitally and on airplay (except "Le Sourire", which was released as CD single and peak at number seven in France). The album achieved some success : it debuted at a peak of number eight on the French albums chart and totaled 70 weeks in the top 200. In Belgium (Wallonia), it started at number 71 on 25 November 2006 and reached number 34 seven weeks later, and fell off the top 100 after 18 weeks. The album passed almost unnoticed in Switzerland where it was ranked low for a sole week.
1516	According to Atlantic Records producer Herb Abramson, Lance wrote the song with his friend Wallace (the brother of the boxer Coley Wallace) after the pair had heard a blues singer on the street in Atlanta, Georgia, singing a mournful song that included the title in its lyrics. The song they heard may have been "One Dime Blues", sung by Blind Lemon Jefferson in the 1920s,  which in the lyrics had the line "Mama, don't treat your daughter mean," and recorded by Blind Willie McTell in 1949. Ruth Brown initially disliked the song but was persuaded by Lance and Wallace to record it in December 1952, after Abramson had speeded up its tempo.
1517	The more successful and well-known recording by Elvis Presley was released in August 1961. The relatively intense tune, featuring a Bo Diddley beat, performed well on both pop and easy listening stations, reaching No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100, and No. 2 on the Easy Listening chart, based (at the time) on the Top 100. However, the single's Hot 100 chart run was atypical of a Top Ten hit. In the autumn of 1961 it shot from 22 to 4, then dropped to 10, then 26, all within the space of four weeks. The single (a double A-side with "Little Sister", as in the States) spent four weeks at No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart — one of Presley's nine UK chart-toppers between 1960 and 1962.
1518	Several cover versions of this song have been recorded. These include a version by alternative-rock band The Smiths (as part of a live medley with their song - already heavily derivative of Presley's original - "Rusholme Ruffians", which can be found on the album Rank), punk band Misfits, the heavy-metal band Scorpions and Italian alternative-rock band Verdena, as well as Brian May.  El Vez released a single, changing the name slightly to "Maria's the Name (of His Latest Flame)". The riff is also quoted in "Don't Play Your Rock'n'Roll to Me" by Smokie.
1519	Country/Americana artist JD Myers recorded it featuring James Burton on guitar, in 1997, on the Asylum Records album Like A Train.  The album never was officially released, but the song appears on the compilation album JD Myers, available on the artist's website. DJ and promo copies of the original album featuring Burton can also be found on that website.The closest cover to Elvis' version of this song was recorded in England on the Embassy Records label in November 1961 by singer Ray Pilgrim, who recorded under the name Bobby Stevens for the label.
1520	(Miss)understood (stylized in all lowercase) is the seventh studio album by Japanese singer-songwriter Ayumi Hamasaki, released January 1, 2006 by Avex Trax. Hamasaki acted as the album's sole lyricist, as she had on all of her preceding albums. (Miss)understood marked new musical directions for Hamasaki: she explored new influences such as funk and used gospel choruses in some of the songs, foreign to her previous works. This was the result of her having heard compositions by Geo from Sweetbox and asking him for his works; subsequently, Hamasaki rewrote the lyrics to fit (Miss)understood. Lyrically, the album was a departure from her previous work, My Story, which had been primarily autobiographical.
1521	"Step You/Is This Love?" was released as the lead single from (Miss)understood on April 20, 2005. It was a commercial success, reaching number one in Japan and receiving a Platinum certification, selling 345,340 copies in its chart run. It was the nineteenth best-selling song in Japan in 2005, and Hamasaki's best-selling single that year. Second single "Fairyland" was released August 3, and debuted at number one in Japan. It sold 170,000 copies in its first week, the most of any single from (Miss)understood. It went on to sell 316,663 copies, receiving a platinum certification. The third single, "Heaven", experienced similar success: it reached number one, and was certified Platinum, selling around 325,000 copies. "Bold & Delicious/Pride" was not as successful. Despite reaching number one, it became her poorest-selling single at the time since 1998's "Depend on You", selling only 133,000 copies.
1522	While My Story, Hamasaki's preceding album, contained mostly "autobiographical" lyrics and "musings about [her] past", (Miss)understood was a "strong message to send to all women": it was a kind of "girl's talk" to give "moral support" while at the same time reminding women that there would be times when they would "feel weak and low". "Bold & Delicious" "scolded indecisive men", "Pride" expressed Hamasaki's appreciation of "women who do not give up easily", and "Ladies Night" was about female camaraderie. Other themes appeared as well: "Is This Love?" and "Heaven" were about love, and "Fairyland" was about "childhood memories".
1523	(Miss)understood is more musically diverse than My Story; Hamasaki incorporated a variety of musical styles including rock, dance-pop and funk. The album opens with "Bold & Delicious", a funk-infused dance track that utilises a gospel choir in the harmony. The song makes use of funk guitars. "Pride" is a ballad song that "sounded like it could be from a musical"; the arrangement of both songs were influenced by Hamasaki's trip to New York City to record the songs and film their respective music videos. An organ Hamasaki heard while visiting a church inspired her to include the gospel choir in "Bold", while the musical The Phantom of the Opera influenced her arrangement of "Pride". "Criminal", "Step You", "Alterna", and the titular "(Miss)understood" are all rock songs with prominent electric guitars, while "Heaven" is an "ethereal" piano-driven ballad. As with "Bold & Delicious" and "Pride", other songs composed by GEO were rearranged; violins were added to the bridge of "Rainy Day", and a choir was added to the chorus of "Beautiful Day".
1524	The initial pressings of the album included two photobooks—one for the CD version (entitled "Off My Day"), and another for the CD+DVD version (entitled "On My Way"). The DVD version included all PV's that were made for her 2005 releases (excluding "My Name's Women")—"Step You", "Is This Love?", "Fairyland", "Alterna", "Heaven", "Bold & Delicious" and "Pride", as well as an alternative PV for "Bold & Delicious" (called the "Side Story"). Two new PVs were also included—"Ladies Night" and "Rainy Day" made their debut on the disc. Behind-the-scenes clips for "Step You", "Is This Love?", "Fairyland", "Alterna", "Heaven" and "Pride" are featured as well. The song "Rainy Day" was used as the ending theme for the game "Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams".
1525	The PV of "Fairyland" was shot in Hawaii and is one of the most expensive music videos in the world, as well as being Japan's most expensive music video in terms of production costs. The PV cost 240 million Yen (2 million in U.S. dollars). The video was directed by Wataru Takeishi and it depicts Hamasaki with her companions (dance team) on a lush tropical island, with some scenes showing a timber house with a deck. Eventually, a fallen oil lamp causes the entire structure to burn. Images from earlier sequences showing the group having fun are interspersed through the burning of the house. The video ends with the camera moving away from Hamasaki singing solemnly as she watches the house burn.
1526	The music video for "Ladies Night" features Ayumi wearing a pink and blue mini dress, and her legendary long blue leg muffs as she walks down a hotel hallway, trying to go into some of the rooms, and occasionally singing into a payphone. Scenes of different things happening in the rooms can be seen. In one room, a maid is mounted on a man and is whipping him. In another room, a woman dressed in a white 18th century dress and white powdered wig is seen walking around her room, which is all white and has a large collection of butterflies. In the third room, a strange woman in a bulky black dress with a long braided black wig and face painted all in black (later revealed to be Ayumi herself) is seen dominating and whipping mannequins. The hotel room scenes have been compared by many to the 1995 indie film Four Rooms. In between the hotel room scenes there are other scenes of Ayumi dressed in a dictator's outfit and addressing an army of bald and pale women in an outdoor arena that resembles the Colosseum. The women all appear to have the same face and march along to Ayumi's singing during the song's middle eight.
1527	The music video of "Rainy Day" features Ayumi with short-black hair singing in a house looking in and out of the window. The scene then cuts to her sitting at a bus stop, wearing a white-powered wig. A dog appears out of an alleyway. The dog and Ayumi stare at each other. During the mid-eight, rain has started to fall and the dog is no longer in the scene. Images of people passing the bus stop with umbrellas are shown. An Hansom cab then arrives and picks up Ayumi. She sees the lone dog again and looks back with a regretful face. The house scenes featuring shows Ayumi collapsing onto the floor and crying.
1528	In 2007, Avex reported that (Miss)understood sold 1,030,000 copies in Japan. (Miss)understood was certified million by RIAJ in sales and was recognized for having more than a million copies shipped to store. On the Oricon Charts, (Miss)understood failed to break a million-selling only a little under 900,000 in 2006, but by 2007 it was able to sell 1,030,000 copies. The total sales number of the album's singles comes to a total of 1,285,000. The album sales and the single sales combined come to a grand sales revenue of 2,315,000 CDs sold.
1529	"(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers" is a song written by Liz Anderson. Best remembered as American country music artist Merle Haggard's first national Top 10 record, it was also a Top 10 song concurrently for Roy Drusky. The song is also known as All My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers, (From Now On) All My Friends Are Gonna Be Strangers, and simply Strangers. Haggard went on to name his band The Strangers after the record's success.  The song was subsequently recorded by scores of additional country stars as an album track including George Jones, Ernest Tubb, Porter Wagoner, Ferlin Husky, as well as Liz Anderson herself and Anderson's daughter Lynn Anderson.
1530	Liz Anderson wrote the song circa 1964 and had sent it to Nashville producers.  Her friend Bonnie Owens encouraged her to meet with Haggard (Owens' beau at the time) and pitch some of her songs to the newcomer.  Anderson was reluctant to do so, having already had songs recorded by national artists and not particularly interested in a regional performer and having never heard Haggard, not certain he had talent but agreed to meet with him out of her loyalty to Owens.  Haggard likewise had never heard of Anderson and was not particularly pleased that Bonnie insisted they go to the Anderson home to listen to some songs however Merle and Liz hit it off and both proved to be in awe of the others' talents, with Haggard eventually recording several songs by Anderson he heard that night.  He was particularly taken with "(My Friends Are Gonna Be) Strangers" and rushed into the studio to record it and planned it for a single release.  After the track had been cut and the single printed, all involved learned Roy Drusky had also just recorded it and was releasing it as a single.  Although both Drusky and Haggard versions eventually made it into the Billboard Hot Country Singles top ten, the competing records undoubtedly kept either version for being a top five and perhaps number one record.
1531	Brian Eno invited Robert Fripp to his London home studio in September 1972. Eno was experimenting with a tape system developed by Terry Riley and Pauline Oliveros where two reel-to-reel tape recorders were set up side-by side.  Sounds recorded on the first deck would be played back by the second deck, and then routed back into the first deck to create a long looping tape delay. Fripp played guitar over Eno's loops, while Eno selectively looped or recorded Fripp's guitar without looping it. The result is a dense, multi-layered piece of ambient music. This technique later came to be known as "Frippertronics"
1532	The second track "Swastika Girls", which fills the other side, was recorded almost a year after "The Heavenly Music Corporation" in August 1973 at Command Studios at 201 Piccadilly in London (where Fripp's King Crimson recorded their acclaimed Larks' Tongues in Aspic album earlier that year). The track employed the same technique as "The Heavenly Music Corporation" except Fripp played to a background electronic loop created by Eno on VCS3. Fripp and Eno took the tapes of "Swastika Girls" to British record producer George Martin's Air Studios at Oxford Circus to continue mixing and assembling the track there. The track's title refers to an image of nude women performing a Nazi salute that was ripped from a discarded pornographic film magazine found by Eno at AIR studios. Eno stuck the image on the recording console while recording the track with Fripp and it became the title of the track.
1533	Released in November 1973, (No Pussyfooting) failed to chart in either the US or UK. Island Records  actively opposed it. The album was released in the same year as Eno's more rock-based solo album Here Come the Warm Jets. Eno was attempting to launch a solo career, having left Roxy Music, and his management bemoaned the confusion caused by two albums with such different styles. Robert Fripp's bandmates in King Crimson also disliked the album. The mainstream rock press paid the album little attention compared to Fripp's work with King Crimson and Eno's solo album.
1534	The album was rereleased on vinyl in 1982, and on CD in 1987 by E.G. Records. Modern reception has been mostly positive. Ted Mills of AllMusic gave the album four and a half stars out of five, praising "Heavenly Music Corporation" and noting "the beauty" of their tape deck setup, yet giving a negative view of "Swastika Girls", suggesting the loop system was abused with "too many disconnected sounds sharing the space, some discordant, some melodic... the resulting work lacks form and structure". Eric Tamm, the author of the Eno biography Brian Eno: His Music and the Vertical Color of Sound (1995) reacted similarly to Mills, stating that "The Heavenly Music Corporation" "anticipated Eno's own ambient style." About "Swastika Girls" Tamm said, "if it is less successful than the earlier piece, it is because of the much greater overall saturation of the acoustical space. There seems to be a perceptual rule that possibilities for appreciation of timbral subtleties decrease in proportion to the rate of actual notes being played. 'Swastika Girls' shows that Eno and Fripp had not yet understood the full weight of this principle".
1535	Also LL Cool J ("Nitro"), Everlast ("Never Missin A Beat"), Tone Lōc ("Funky Cold Medina"), MC Hammer & Deion Sanders ("Straight to My Feet"), The rap group Mass 187 ("Swang Your Hips)", G-Funk Intro & his unreleased track "Do U Remember". Tha Dogg Pound used the sample in their unreleased track "Can't C Us". Geto Boys sampled the intro for "Homie Don't Play That". The Black Eyed Peas also used the beat behind it to remix their hit single "Shut Up". X Clan sampled the song in "Funkin' Lesson". It was also interpolated in the song "Get Away" by Bobby Brown. In 2014, it was sampled in Jessie J's "Seal Me with a Kiss".
1536	In 1967, Bob Dylan recorded the song during the Basement Tape sessions. For many years never officially released, the recording had been widely bootlegged, and was finally released November 4, 2014, on The Bootleg Series Vol. 11: The Basement Tapes Complete. Dylan recorded the song again in April 1969; that version was released in 1973 by Columbia on the Dylan album. On the 1973 Dylan album and several associated Columbia 1973 singles, the song is wrongly credited to "B. Abner" and "LeFevre Sing Pub Co (BMI)". This is a different song with the same title, written by Buford Abner of the Swanee River Boys. This mistake has not been corrected, and on www.bobdylan.com the song is still credited to "B. Abner".
1537	"(Old Dogs, Children And) Watermelon Wine" is a song written and recorded by American country music artist Tom T. Hall. It was released in November 1972 as the second and final single from the album, The Storyteller. The song was Hall's third number one on the U.S. country singles chart and earned him his second nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Country Song. "(Old Dogs, Children And) Watermelon Wine" spent one week at the top and a total of thirteen weeks on the chart.  On June 1, 2014, Rolling Stone magazine ranked "(Old Dogs, Children and) Watermelon Wine" #93 in their list of the 100 greatest country songs.
1538	"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away" was released as the third single from Andy Gibb's Shadow Dancing album, but only in the United States, in September 1978. The song was also his fifth single to reach the US Top 10; the single reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and #2 on the Adult Contemporary chart. When Andy Gibb was going to record it, Barry reworked on the song adding the middle eight that was not on the original Bee Gees' version, as Blue Weaver recalls, "When Andy actually went to record it, Barry listened to it [the original version] again and thought, 'Oh, it's not finished', so Barry wrote the whole of the middle-eight.
1539	Barry wrote the lyrics while Weaver composed the melody. Weaver said of this song, "That was me playing around again; It wasn't done for [Saturday Night Fever], it was just something that we did". The stereo mix of an early state of the song exists but was unreleased until now. Samantha Sang, who was visiting France where this version was recorded, asked Barry for a song; not long afterwards, Barry sent Sang "Don't Throw it All Away", but Sang never recorded or released it, choosing instead the new song "Emotion".
1540	X-ray crystallographic data determined Cp*Al to exist exclusively as a tetramer in its solid state. This tetramer, [Cp*Al]4, consists of an Al4 tetrahedron, and the Cp* rings are ŋ5-coordinated to the aluminium(I) cation such that the planes of the C5Me5- rings are approximately parallel to the opposite base of the Al4 tetrahedron. The perpendicular distance between Al and the Cp* ring was determined through crystallography to range from 199.7 to 203.2 pm, with a mean value of 201.5 pm. The Al-Al bond in [Cp*Al]4 is 276.9 pm, which is slightly shorter than that of metallic aluminium, which has an Al-Al bond length of 286 pm. Additionally, the Al-Al bond in [Cp*Al]4 is significantly shorter than other oligomeric and polymeric Group III M(I)-ŋ5-Cp* compounds such as octahedral [InCp*]6 (394, 336 pm), dimeric [InCp*]2 (363.1 pm), and polymeric [TlCp*] (641 pm), indicating a significantly larger interaction between aluminium atoms in [Cp*Al]4 than monovalent Cp* compounds of In(I) and Tl(I). Additional characterization that has been performed include Raman spectroscopy, which detected a Raman active breathing vibration (A1, 377 cm-1) of the Al4 tetrahedron in [Cp*Al]4.
1541	Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis of [Cp*Al] and [Cp*Al]4 using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) calculated the average charge transfer per Cp* fragment to an Al atom to be 0.657 and 0.641 respectively. This is slightly higher than the charge transfers calculated on [CpAl] and [Cp*Al]4 (0.630 and 0.591 respectively). NBO calculation of the HOMO-LUMO gap in [Cp*Al] also revealed a significant decreasing in the tetrameric [Cp*Al]4 complex compared to the monomeric [Cp*Al] (4.36 compared to 5.49), which is consistent with density functional theory calculations of analogous systems including superatom complexes of gold, aluminium and gallium. Atoms in molecules (AIM) calculations calculate the Al-Al bonding to be metallic. Stabilization of [Cp*Al]4 relative to [CpAl]4 is thought to arise from addition of H-H interactions on the methyl groups attached to the Cp* ligand as opposed to the increased Al-Al bonding interactions.
1542	At temperatures above 100 °C, [Cp*Al]4 decomposes to form pentamethylcyclopentandiene (Cp*H), metallic aluminium (Al(0)) and other non-volatile Al(III) compounds. The overall stability of [Cp*Al]4 is unique as there is a thermodynamic affinity for tetrameric aluminium(I) compounds ([RAl]4) to disproportionate into elemental aluminium and R3Al. As such, a number of different novel oligomeric structures can be synthesised when using tetrameric [Cp*Al]4 as a precursor. For example, treatment of [Cp*Al]4 with excess selenium and tellurium in mild conditions gives the unique heterocubane structures [Cp*AlSe]4 and [Cp*AlTe]4 respectively. These heterocubane structures are extremely air and moisture sensitive, leading to its decomposition and evolution of H2Se and H2Te respectively. Analogously, reaction of [Cp*Al]4 with lighter chalcogens such as O2, N2O and sulfur yield [Cp*AlX]4 (X = O, S).
1543	Bassist Leon Wilkeson left the band a few months before the album's recording sessions. Ex-Strawberry Alarm Clock guitarist Ed King had been impressed with the band after an earlier incarnation of Skynyrd had opened for Strawberry Alarm Clock in Florida circa 1970. He told vocalist Ronnie Van Zant to keep him in mind if he ever needed a guitarist, and he was invited to replace Wilkeson as bassist. Once the recording sessions were wrapping up, Van Zant decided that King would better serve the band as a guitarist, and he visited Wilkeson and convinced him to rejoin. Wilkeson returned to the band and King moved to lead guitar, giving the band what would become their trademark "Three Guitar Army" along with Allen Collins and Gary Rossington.  Wilkeson was back in the band by the time the band shot the cover photo for the album, and appears on the cover, as well as being acknowledged in the liner notes.
1544	(RED)Wire is an online magazine and music service created by Bono (of the Irish rock band U2) and Bobby Shriver. It is a part of the broader Product RED organization, which serves to work with corporations who are contracted to give a percentage of their profits for particular products to the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS in Africa. (RED)Wire was created on World AIDS Day on December 1, 2006. Each issue contains an exclusive song from a major artist and a "spotlight" song from an up-and-coming artist, as well as other non-music media, such as video clips, poems, and so on.
1545	The music video for the song begins with a young man walking down the street, kicking a can. Walking up to a puddle, the man finds a ticket with "Rap Superstar" written on it. A fun house suddenly pops up and the man hands the ticket to Sen Dog, then enters. In one of the rooms, the man sees a group of women who dress him up in a suit. In another room, the man listens to a speech being given by B-Real, dressed as Fidel Castro. In another room, TV screens show rappers Eminem and Noreaga giving testimonies about the rap business. At the video's climax, the man goes to a performance by the band before being chased by the crowd. As the man exits the fun house, an explosion occurs and the man smiles.
1546	"(Reach Up for The) Sunrise" is a song recorded by English pop rock band Duran Duran. It was released as the lead single from their eleventh studio album, Astronaut (2004) and their 31st single overall. It was the first single since "A View to a Kill" in 1985 to feature all five of the original members of the band. Upon its release, the song debuted and peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart, giving the band their fourteenth top-ten hit in their native country. It was highly successful in Italy, where it reached number two, as well as in Denmark and Spain, peaking at number six in both countries. In the United States, the single topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, Duran Duran's third and last song to do so.
1547	The single was released on 27 September and 28 September 2004 in various markets. "Sunrise" peaked at number five on the UK Singles Chart in October 2004 and reached number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart on 4 December 2004. The Jason Nevins newly produced version is the main version of the song. It marked the band's first top ten since "Ordinary World" in the UK, even though its chart stay was only four weeks. Elsewhere, the song reached number six in Denmark and Spain and number two in Italy, where it became the soundtrack of a telephone advertising campaign.
1548	The song's music video is very similar to the previous single, "(Rap) Superstar", with the man picking up a ticket that says "Rock Superstar" on it. After giving the ticket to Sen Dog, the man enters into a fun house. A group of women dress up the man in a suit, before he wanders off. After seeing a testimony on a TV screen from Everlast, he encounters many record executives. At the video's climax, the man is chased out after going to a performance by Cypress Hill. As the man exits the fun house, it blows up behind him.
1549	This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase (2-methylfumarate-forming). Other names in common use include mesaconate hydratase, (+)-citramalate hydro-lyase, L-citramalate hydrolase, citramalate dehydratase, (+)-citramalic hydro-lyase, mesaconate mesaconase, mesaconase, and (S)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase.  This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. In addition, the family of lyases which is also an enzyme catalyzes the breaking  the elimination reaction of the variety of amounts of chemical bonds from hydrolysis (a substitution reaction ) and oxidation, which forms a new double bond or a new ring structure.
1550	In nature, the liberation of cyanide serves as a defense mechanism against herbivores and microbial attack in plants. Hydroxynitrile lyases of the α/β hydrolase fold are closely related to esterases. All members of the α/β hydrolase fold contain a conserved catalytic triad (nucleophile-histidine-aspartate). The nucleophile in this case is a serine. In contrast to esterases, serine proteases, lipases and other enzymes in this family, the nucleophile in hydroxynitrile lyases functions as a proton acceptor. Key amino acid residues in this reaction are the lysine at position 236 and the threonine at position 11. Lys236 helps to orient the substrate while Thr11 serves to block the oxyanion hole that would convert the enzyme into an esterase.
1551	This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include (-)-limonene 6-hydroxylase, (-)-limonene 6-monooxygenase, and (-)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6-hydroxylating).  This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and limonene and pinene degradation.  It employs one cofactor, heme.
1552	This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include (-)-limonene 7-monooxygenase, (-)-limonene hydroxylase, (-)-limonene monooxygenase, and (-)-limonene,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating).  This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis and limonene and pinene degradation.  It employs one cofactor, heme.
1553	This enzyme transfers the electron pair from FMNH2 to a component of the electron transport chain, most probably ubiquinone [1,2]. It is part of a metabolic pathway in Pseudomonads that allows theseorganisms to utilize mandelic acid, derivatized from the common soil metabolite amygdalin, as the sole source of carbon and energy. The enzyme has a large active-site pocket and preferentially bindssubstrates with longer sidechains, e.g. 2-hydroxyoctanoate rather than 2-hydroxybutyrate. It also prefers substrates that, like (S)-mandelate, have beta unsaturation, e.g. (indol-3-yl)glycolate compared with(indol-3-yl)lactate. Esters of mandelate, such as methyl (S)-mandelate, are also substrates.
1554	First, it is necessary to encode when the verifier accepts in 3CNF clauses     ϕ =  ⋀  r    ϕ  r     {\displaystyle \phi =\bigwedge _{r}\phi _{r}} . Next, for each random string r, construct a sub-formula      ϕ  r     {\displaystyle \phi _{r}} . For a fixed r, its possible to determine all the variables queried,Enumerate each random string r, and add a clause      ϕ  r   =  f  r   (  y   i  1     ,  y   i  2     , … ,  y   i  q     )     {\displaystyle \phi _{r}=f_{r}(y_{i_{1}},y_{i_{2}},\ldots ,y_{i_{q}})\ } , where      f  r     {\displaystyle f_{r}}  is true if and only if the PCP system accepts on reading the given random bits r.  There are at most      2  q     {\displaystyle 2^{q}}  SAT clauses. After these clauses are converted into 3CNF clauses, there are at most     q  2  q     {\displaystyle q2^{q}}  clauses.
1555	If     x ∈ L   {\displaystyle x\in L} , then there is a proof y such that is accepted for every random string r. Therefore,     ϕ (  y  1   ,  y  2   , … ,  y  m   )   {\displaystyle \phi (y_{1},y_{2},\ldots ,y_{m})}  is satisfiable.If     x ∉ L   {\displaystyle x\notin L} , then for every assignment to      y  1   ,  y  2   , … ,  y  m     {\displaystyle y_{1},y_{2},\ldots ,y_{m}}  the corresponding proof causes the verifier to reject for half of the random strings r. For each r that is rejected  one of the clauses in      f  r     {\displaystyle f_{r}}  fails. Therefore, at least     ϵ =   1  2 q  2  q        {\displaystyle \epsilon ={\frac {1}{2q2^{q}}}}  fraction of the clauses fail.
1556	For     ( S A T , ϵ − U N S A T ) ∈ P C P ( O ( log ⁡ n ) , O ( 1 ) )   {\displaystyle (SAT,\epsilon -UNSAT)\in PCP(O(\log n),O(1))} , let the proof that the PCP system reads be a satisfying assignment for the input 3-CNF, Φ.  The system chooses     O ( 1  /  ϵ )   {\displaystyle O(1/\epsilon )}  clauses of the proof to check if they are truly satisfied.  Note that only     log ⁡ n   {\displaystyle \log n}  random bits are needed to choose one of     n   {\displaystyle n}  clauses, and thus only     O ( log ⁡ n  /  ϵ ) = O ( log ⁡ n )   {\displaystyle O(\log n/\epsilon )=O(\log n)}  total random bits are needed.  (Remember that ε is a constant.)  For each clause to be checked, only 3 bits need to be read, and thus only     O ( 3  /  ϵ ) = O ( 1 )   {\displaystyle O(3/\epsilon )=O(1)}  (a constant number) of bits from the proof need to be read.  The system rejects if any of the clauses are not satisfied.  If Φ is satisfiable, then there exists a proof (a truly satisfying assignment) that the system will always accept.  If Φ is not in (SAT, ε-UNSAT), this means that an ε fraction of the clauses is not satisfiable.  The probability that this system will accept in this case is     ( 1 − ϵ  )  1  /  ϵ   ≤ 1  /  e < 1  /  2   {\displaystyle (1-\epsilon )^{1/\epsilon }\leq 1/e<1/2} .  Therefore,     ( S A T , ϵ − U N S A T ) ∈ P C P ( O ( log ⁡ n ) , O ( 1 ) )   {\displaystyle (SAT,\epsilon -UNSAT)\in PCP(O(\log n),O(1))} .
1557	"(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty" is a song recorded and released in 1976 by KC and the Sunshine Band for the album Part 3. The song became their third number-one hit on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as their third number-one on the Hot Soul Singles chart. The song was met with a degree of controversy, since the lyrics were interpreted or likely speculated by many as having sexual connotations. However, according to KC, it had a lot more meaning and depth. During his performance he would witness the entire crowd having a good time except for some minority. The song inspired people to "get off their can and get out there and do it". The B-side of Shake Your Booty was "Boogie Shoes", which later became a hit on its own when it appeared on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack in 1977.
1558	The song was inspired by Fieger's as-yet-unrequited passion for Sharona Alperin, girlfriend of Doug Fieger, who also inspired other Knack songs such as "My Sharona," and Averre has called it a "teasing, playful look" at her.  Alperin concurs that she was the inspiration.  According to Ed Stephens, Jr. of Saipan Tribune, the song is about a "manipulative tease."  Taking a line from the song, Ira Robbins and Michael Sandlin of Trouser Press describe the girl in the song as "rich bitch."  Ultimate Classic Rock writer Dave Swanson included it as one of the Knack's "top shelf, hook-laden rockers" but acknowledged that it is "full of words that wouldn't fly past radio censors."  Critic Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times describes that the Knack uses crude, locker room language to portray a teenager's view of frustration.  Robert Wilonsky of the Dallas Observer described it as a "teen-beat [anthem] about doin' it to your girlfriend while Mom and Dad were out of the house"
1559	The Associated Press, TV Guide and others identified "(She's So) Selfish" as one of the Knack's radio hits.  Terry Atkinson of the Los Angeles Times calls it "one of the Knack's better songs."  Mike Daily of The Age claims that it deserves equal credit with "My Sharona" for the success of Get the Knack.  Audio magazine called it a "basher" with "plenty of style".  Tina Maples of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel praised its "hooky effervescence".  Charla Wasel of The Evening Independent described it as a song "with which we can all relate." Billboard Magazine says that it is "delivered in a smart, sophisticated post-punk style that oozes Southern Californian snootiness."  It also uses the song as an example of the Knack being "mad about the way things are" with lyrics that "are as innocent as the chief of police in a Latin American dictatorship," citing such lines as "she got a smile in her ass" and "she says she'll make your motor run but she won't give you none" as setting the tone.  Author John Borack described "(She's So) Selfish" as a "mean pop tune" in which Fieger comes off "like a leering, sexist twit with hormones a-raging."  J. J. Syrja of The Seguin Gazette said that with this song the Knack "[struck] pure teenage delirium."  Paul Wagner of Santa Cruz Sentinel claimed that "it had the same sparkle" as "My Sharona."
1560	Cue New York criticized the "sexist get-a-girl lyrics."  Jim Sullivan of The Boston Globe calls it "a tiresome, sexist rant."  The 3rd edition of The Rolling Stone Album Guide, music critic Robert Christgau and other critics commented on the song's nastiness, with authors Michael Uslan and Bruce Solomon calling it "by far the nastiest and most up-front cut on the album."  Eric Siegel of The Sun claims that lines such as "It's just me me me me/She's so (dramatic pause) selfish" make apparent the group's "lack of lyrical ability," comparing the lyrics unfavorably to Carly Simon's similarly themed "You're So Vain."
1561	Capitol Records wanted to release "(She's So) Selfish" as a follow-up single from Get the Knack to "My Sharona" and "Good Girls Don't" in time for Christmas 1979.  However, they could not do so unless some of the more "scatological" references were edited out.  The band, having already edited out some lyrics for the single release of "Good Girls Don't," refused to do it again, preventing the single release.  According to Knack bassist Prescott Niles, Fieger felt that altering the lyrics to "(She's So) Selfish" would be "selling out."  Averre didn't see anything problematic about including the profane lyrics, since that is how teenagers spoke and they heard such language all the time.
1562	"(She's So) Selfish" was a staple of the Knack's live shows and was included in several of the band's live albums, generally towards the end of the set right before "My Sharona."  It was included on the 2012 live album Havin' a Rave-Up! Live in Los Angeles, 1978, which was based on two concerts the band performed in Los Angeles, California in 1978, before signing their record deal that would lead to Get the Knack.  The Knack performed it at the 1979 concert at Carnegie Hall which was used for the 1982 video disc The Knack Live at Carnegie Hall.  It was later included on the 2002 CD of Live From the Rock 'N' Roll Funhouse and on the 2007 DVD On Stage at World Cafe Live.
1563	The song "(She Was A) Hotel Detective", which was written by John Flansburgh, first appeared on They Might Be Giants, the band's debut album. It was later followed up by "She Was a Hotel Detective", which appeared on an EP, Back to Skull, released in 1994. The sequel was written by John Linnell, "in the tradition of 'Peggy Sue Got Married' and 'Let's Twist Again'". The lyrics to "She Was A Hotel Detective" (the sequel) include the phrase "motel directive", which is transcribed between the leadout grooves of the original Hotel Detective vinyl EP.
1564	While on tour with the Bar-Kays in August 1967, Redding wrote the first verse of the song, under the abbreviated title "Dock of the Bay," on a houseboat at Waldo Point in Sausalito, California. He had completed his famed performance at the Monterey Pop Festival just weeks earlier. While touring in support of the albums King & Queen (a collaboration with female vocalist Carla Thomas) and Live in Europe, he continued to scribble lines of the song on napkins and hotel paper. In November of that year, he joined producer and guitarist Steve Cropper at the Stax recording studio in Memphis, Tennessee, to record the song.
1565	Otis was one of those the kind of guy who had 100 ideas. [...] He had been in San Francisco doing The Fillmore. And the story that I got he was renting boathouse or stayed at a boathouse or something and that's where he got the idea of the ships coming in the bay there. And that's about all he had: "I watch the ships come in and I watch them roll away again." I just took that... and I finished the lyrics. If you listen to the songs I collaborated with Otis, most of the lyrics are about him. [...] Otis didn't really write about himself but I did. Songs like "Mr. Pitiful," "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)"; they were about Otis and Otis' life. "Dock of the Bay" was exactly that: "I left my home in Georgia, headed for the Frisco Bay" was all about him going out to San Francisco to perform.
1566	Together, they completed the music and melancholic lyrics of "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay." From those sessions emerged Redding's final recorded work, including "Dock of the Bay," which was recorded on November 22, with additional overdubs on December 7. Redding's restrained yet emotive delivery is backed by Cropper's succinct guitar playing. The song is somewhat different in style from most of Redding's other recordings. While discussing the song with his wife, Redding stated that he had wanted to "be a little different" with "The Dock of the Bay" and "change his style". There were concerns that "The Dock of the Bay" had too much of a pop feel for an Otis Redding record, and contracting the Stax gospel act the Staple Singers to record backing vocals was discussed but never carried out. Redding had considered the song to be unfinished and planned to record what he considered a final version, but never got the chance. The song features a whistled tune heard before the song's fade. It was originally performed by Redding, who (according to Cropper) had "this little fadeout rap he was gonna do, an ad-lib. He forgot what it was so he started whistling." Redding continued to tour after the recording sessions. On December 10, his charter plane crashed into Lake Monona, outside Madison, Wisconsin. Redding and six others were killed.
1567	"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" was released in January 1968, shortly after Redding's death. R&B stations quickly added the song to their playlists, which had been saturated with Redding's previous hits. The song shot to number one on the R&B charts in early 1968 and, starting in March, topped the pop charts for four weeks. The album, which shared the song's title, became his largest-selling to date, peaking at number four on the pop albums chart. "Dock of the Bay" was popular in countries across the world and became Redding's most successful record, selling more than four million copies worldwide. The song went on to win two Grammy Awards: Best R&B Song and Best Male R&B Vocal Performance.
1568	Redding's body of work at the time of his death was immense, including a backlog of archived recordings as well as those created in November and December 1967, just before his death. In mid-1968, Stax Records severed its distribution contract with Atlantic Records, which retained the label's back catalog and the rights to the unreleased Otis Redding masters. Through its Atco subsidiary (Atco had distributed Otis Redding's releases from Stax's Volt label), Atlantic issued three more albums of new Redding material, one live album, and eight singles between 1968 and 1970. Reprise Records issued a live album featuring Redding and Jimi Hendrix at the Monterey Pop Festival. Both studio albums and anthologies sold well in America and abroad. Redding was especially successful in the United Kingdom, where The Dock of the Bay went to number one, becoming the first posthumous album to reach the top spot there.
1569	Jim Morrison made reference to "Dock of the Bay" in the Doors' song "Runnin' Blue", written by Robby Krieger, from their 1969 album The Soft Parade. Morrison sings an a capella intro for the song, singing directly about Otis Redding. "Poor Otis dead and gone, left me here to sing his song, pretty little girl with a red dress on, poor Otis dead and gone." And during the verse, the lyrics "Got to find a dock and a bay" appear more than once; as well as several other references to Redding's song.
1570	"The Dock of the Bay" has been hugely popular, even after its stay at the top of the charts. The song has been recorded by many artists, from Redding's peers, like Glen Campbell, Cher, Peggy Lee, David Allan Coe, Bob Dylan, Don Partridge, Percy Sledge, Dee Clark, and Sam & Dave, to artists in various genres, including Jimmy Velvit (whose cover version was included on his 2001 Grammy-nominated album Sun Sea & Sand), Widespread Panic (who opened their New Year's Eve 2005 concert with the song), Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson (whose duet peaked at number 13 on the U.S. Hot Country Songs chart), Kenny Rankin, Dennis Brown, Michel Pagliaro, Jacob Miller, Pearl Jam, the Format, T. Rex (as the B-side of "Dreamy Lady", released in 1975), Brent Smith of Shinedown (during an acoustic set in 2008 and with Zach Myers in a 2014 EP) and Garth Brooks (for the 2013 Blue-Eyed Soul album in the Blame It All on My Roots: Five Decades of Influences compilation) as well as John Hartford on the Retrograss album with David Grisman and Mike Seeger (1999).
1571	In addition to the original Otis Redding version, several other versions have charted on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. King Curtis's version charted for five weeks starting in March 1968 and peaked at number 84 (during the same month, the original was number one). A year later, Sergio Mendes & Brasil '66's version charted for five weeks starting in June 1969 and peaked at number 66. Sammy Hagar's version charted for five weeks starting in April 1979, peaking at number 65. The Reddings, who included two of Otis Redding's sons, released a version which charted for nine weeks starting in June 1982 and peaked at number 55.
1572	{Songbook} A Collection of Hits is the first greatest hits album by country singer Trisha Yearwood. The album was Yearwood's first to reach #1 on the Billboard country albums chart. Due to the success of the single "How Do I Live" in Australia, the album was released there (in 1998) with six extra tracks, including a duet with Australian country star Lee Kernaghan. {Songbook} A Collection of Hits also peaked at number 5 on the ARIA country charts and 22 on the all genre. The album has been certified 4× Multi-Platinum by the RIAA for US shipments of 4 million copies. It has also been certified 2× Platinum in Canada and Platinum in Australia.
1573	"(Still a) Weirdo" is a song by Scottish recording artist KT Tunstall. It was released as the UK lead single from her third studio album Tiger Suit (2010), on 19 September 2010. Written by Tunstall herself and Greg Kurstin, and produced by Kurstin, the song is an acoustic rock ballad and talks about still the same (weird) person after many years. It received critical acclaim, with the majority of the critics complimenting Tunstall for the ability to make an intelligent, simple song. It charted inside the top-forty on the UK Singles Chart at No.39 and currently remains her last UK top 40 hit. It charted also on the Belgian charts. In the music video, Tunstall travels back in time to the 1960s.
1574	Nick Levine from Digital Spy gave a positive review and rated the song with 4 stars out of 5. He says that "in the decidedly less jazzy hands of KT Tunstall, it becomes a sweetly self-deprecating and quietly optimistic little ditty about accepting your faults and making the best of it. 'I don't always get it right, but a thousand different ways and I just might,' she sings over an off-kilter and subtly inventive mix of piano, vocal loops and beatbox beats that has a wee hint of The X-Files theme to it. The overall effect is not unlike getting a bear hug and being told you're OK really by your best mate the morning after you disgraced yourself down the local in front of your ex - in short, just lovely." Matthew Horton from BBC Music said that: "More surprising is "(Still a) Weirdo", a quirky slice of Beatlesy clever-pop that recalls Elliott Smith". Greg Kot from Entertainment Weekly said,:"Tunstall keeps enough off-kilter grit in her voice to make the claim in "(Still a) Weirdo" stick". Victoria Dillingham from musicOMH gave an extremely positive review for the song, saying: "The pre-released single "(Still a) Weirdo" is a light playful track which prompts comparisons with the likes of Feist, Allie Moss and electronica/folk favourites Peter Bjorn And John. As infectious as it is original, this is easily the standout track of the album and exemplifies best the Brit Award winner's ability to marry disparate styles as well as her desire to experiment with her sound, aided and abetted by a revised band and Arctic Monkeys producer Jim Abbiss". Charlotte Andrews from The Guardian said: "The sweetly reflective first single "(Still a) Weirdo" – affirm Tunstall's skill at penning catchy yet credible pop hits".
1575	The lyrics of "(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball" propose taking advantage of nature to solve one's problems.  An example is the opening verse "Well you know sometimes it gets so hard/And everything don't seem to rhyme/I take a walk out in my backyard and go/Do do loo do do, do do loo, do do."  The lyrics show country music influences with references to love, weather and being outdoors.  In reviewing Tupelo Honey, Rolling Stone Magazine critic Jon Landau suggested that "(Straight to Your Heart) Like a Cannonball" "transmutes the expression of generalized need for excitement and fulfillment on [the previous song and hit single] "Wild, Wild Night" into an expression of desire for a single person."
1576	The music is lively with a triple metre time signature.  The feel of the music shows jazz and R&B influences.  Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn suggested that it as an "uptempo spirit."  Producer Ted Templeman felt that Ronnie Montrose's electric guitar playing was particularly effective on this song, stating that his "infectious strummimg and catchy fills made 'Cannonball' worthy of release as a single."  Templeman also praised the 2-note hook Montrose played after the "Do do loo do do, do do loo, do do" line that ends most of the verses.  Templeman felt that "it was a simple lick that any guitarist could have played but the way he played was special.  It brightened the tune right up and gave it this pop sheen."  Morrison played acoustic guitar on the song.  Copley News Service critic Judy Hugg praised "Boots" Houston's flute playing on the song.
1577	Co-director Cabral was a student living in Harlem when her downstairs neighbor of four years, Saeed Torres, disappeared in May 2005. Cabral's investigation into his disappearance eventually became the subject of her film. Shortly before Torres' disappearance, Sutcliffe and Cabral met at an afterschool arts program, where one of their students, Adama Bah, a 16-year-old Muslim teenage girl was arrested by the FBI and accused of being a "potential" suicide bomber. Her arrest triggered a growing interest for both Cabral and Sutcliffe in the FBI's counterterrorism tactics, and an increasing awareness of the central role of informants in the majority of domestic terror plots.
1578	The song was first issued on 2 June 1967 when the compilation album From the Beginning was released, this album contains unreleased recordings and other hit recordings from the band's earlier output. This version was released by Decca and is thought to be a demo for British singer Chris Farlowe. A revamped version was included as the opening track on the group's second studio album Small Faces on 23 June 1967. This version was released by Immediate and was used as the closing track for There Are But Four Small Faces, the group's album released exclusively in the US.
1579	The principal difference between the two versions is that the Decca version has a slower tempo than the Immediate, and that the Immediate version has a different vocal track. The Decca rendering was released exclusively in mono sound (as with all Small Faces' work on Decca), while the Immediate one was mixed in both stereo and mono. There are thought to exist 4 versions of the song, these are the two aforementioned versions, one on the deluxe edition of From the Beginning, and the last on the deluxe edition of Small Faces. Instrumentally, there's no difference, as these are only different vocal takes.
1580	One of the aforementioned outtakes were featured on The Decca Years, a box set of all Small Faces Decca recordings. The song was well-received upon release, and is considered one of the best songs on Small Faces. "(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me?" was featured in German music magazine Musikexpress' list of "the 700 best songs of all time" at a position of number 568, where they write that "Marriott is in his best form". It was later featured on Here Come the Nice: The Immediate Years 1967-1969 on 27 January 2014.
1581	British rock band the Apostolic Intervention took interest in Steve Marriott, who liked their sound and persuaded Andrew Loog Oldham to sign them. Marriott would then subsequently offer "(Tell Me) Have You Ever Seen Me" to them, much to Ronnie Lane's dismay. Bass guitarist Bob Argent was unable to play for the session, and his role was taken over by Marriott, who also produced it with Lane. The B-side "Madame Garcia" was recorded in the same session and was likewise penned and produced by Marriott and Lane, the former whom is featured as a backing vocalist.
1582	Primer 55 had underdone various lineup changes preceding and during the recording process of (the) New Release. After the band's first eighteen months of touring, guitarist Bobby Burns started writing the band's second major label album. He played all guitars and bass in the studio and brought in ex-Helmet drummer John Stanier. While in the studio, Burns also began talks with drummer Preston Nash of Dope with whom Primer 55 had previously toured. By May 2001, the band had officially recruited former Cut.Love.Kill bassist Chris Sprinkle but mere weeks later announced Kobie Jackson as their new bassist.
1583	Whereas the band's major label debut, Introduction to Mayhem, boasted strong hip hop tendencies, (the) New Release demonstrated a broader variety with bluesy vocals, saxophone, and piano scattered throughout. Regarding the band's new musical direction, Bobby Burns stated  "I just grew very, very sick of the whole music scene last year... All the plastic bands that were put together by record companies, etc. I didn't want to hear any of that music any longer... So I didn't... I went back to what was real to me and what made me feel good growing up... Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Kiss... Back then you could tell all those bands apart, and music of today just sounds like the same records made over and over with all the same guitar sounds and shit." Vocalist Jason "J-Sin" Luttrell remarked in 2001 that "During the writing and recording period, we never listened to the radio or watched MTV because we didn't want any outside influences creeping into the songs. We wanted everything to be fresh."
1584	Although Burns had hoped to see "Texas" become the second single, (the) New Release featured only one single, the aggressive, industrial laden "This Life" which was released to radio on July 16. It had no accompanying video but gained moderate radio rotation in late summer and early fall of 2001. The track was also included on More Fast and Furious: Music from and Inspired by the Motion Picture The Fast and the Furious and Nu Rock Traxx, Vol. 32. Promotion was allegedly cut short by Island, forcing the album's success to rely heavily on touring.
1585	The Kay Starr recording of the song, made in 1955, reached number one on the Billboard singles chart in 1956, staying there for six weeks. The recording was released by RCA Victor as catalog number 47-6359. It was Kay Starr's first recording of great significance for RCA Victor after leaving Capitol Records.  She had a number of lesser chart entries on RCA in 1955, including "Good and Lonesome" and "Turn Right". She thought it was a joke when the A&R staff at RCA Victor picked it for her; it was so different from what she was used to recording. It was a No. 1 hit, a million seller, and one of the early songs of the rock and roll era.
1586	I wrote it in 10 minutes on a train out of Liverpool — the whole song in one gulp. ... And then there was the whole comedic thing of getting it down. Nowadays you can demo things on your phone. I had to block it out in my mind. Then I had to get off the train, get to my mother's house, grab an old guitar I had there and play the song until I imprinted it in my memory. I had no tape recorder. I had no way other than repetition to drill it into my head so I wouldn't lose it.
1587	The Wall Street Journal described the song as "a surrealist tale about an imagined jilting and the appearance of earthbound angels offering the singer immortality—in exchange for his footwear". Costello explained, "I had the essential image, then I worked backward — a dancehall scene with the put-down lines. That kind of framed this other, weirder idea of 'I won't get any older' — I went, 'Why am I saying this when I'm 22?'" He later said of the lyrics, "The verses were a pretty standard tale of romantic disappointment. Okay, it had a couple of snappy put-down lines, but they were nothing so out of the ordinary". He speculated that the lyric "Oh, I said, 'I'm so happy I could die' / She said, 'Drop dead' then left with another guy" may have been inspired by a "drunken journey home" in 1973.
1588	"(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes" was recorded a few months after it was written to appear on Costello's 1977 debut album, My Aim Is True. The song was later released as the third single from the album in July 1977. The B-side of the single was "Mystery Dance", another song from My Aim Is True. Preceding singles "Less Than Zero" and "Alison" were unsuccessful, but the popularity of My Aim Is True gave Costello hope for the single; Costello recalled, "'(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes' was my third Stiff Records single to be released. The first two ... had sunk without a trace, but after initially scant sales, all the publicity around the release of My Aim Is True had actually threatened to push 'Red Shoes' into the singles charts". Despite the greater visibility, the single failed to chart.
1589	James Honeyman-Scott of the Pretenders cited the song, alongside Nick Lowe's "So It Goes", as one of the inspirations for his jangly guitar sound. He explained, "They had this big, jangly guitar sound, which is what I'd been wanting to get into for a long while. All of a sudden the radio's on and there's this huge guitar sound coming out, like sending out a big Rickenbacker 12-string or something. And I thought, 'Ah, my time is here.' So that's what happened. And then I hooked up with the Pretenders."
1590	"(The Best Part of) Breaking Up" is a song written by Phil Spector, Pete Andreoli and Vince Poncia.  It was first recorded by The Ronettes, produced by Phil Spector and arranged by Jack Nitzsche with Ronnie Spector on lead vocals and with backing vocals by Nedra Talley and Estelle Bennett, ably abetted by Darlene Love and the Blossoms, Bobby Sheen (a.k.a. Bob B. Soxx), and Sonny & Cher. The song was released in April 1964, the year widely recognized as the group's most successful year, and proved to be the group's third consecutive top forty hit in the US.  The single peaked at number 39 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 43 on the UK Singles Chart.
1591	With the British invasion in full force during 1964, many of the previous American groups from the late 1950s/early 1960s found their popularity beginning to seriously wane.  For the Ronettes, however, 1964 proved to be their biggest year. While none of their singles matched the success of their 1963 classic "Be My Baby", the group released four songs, all of which reached the top forty on the Billboard Charts in the US. Before making "(The Best Part of) Breakin' Up," their previous single had been the successful "Baby, I Love You", which peaked at number twenty-four on the Billboard charts.
1592	Reviewing a stage production, Curtain Up wrote "Van Cleave is a powerhouse recounting “The Legend of Miss Baltimore Crabs”". Reviewing the film, BBC wrote "Michelle Pfeiffer is deliciously icy as scheming TV mogul Velma Von Tusselle, cha-cha-cha-ing in (“The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs”.". Reviewing a stage version, Drew Sterwald of The News-Press commented "Tracy's nemesis...really sinks her teeth into the rotten role and delivers a show-stopping solo, "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs”". IBJ noted that one performer "turns what the one-note evil TV producer Velma von Tussle and her “(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs” number into a show highlight." Reviewing a 90 minute intermissionless version performed in Las Vegas, TheaterMania wrote "The only other two numbers to be cut completely, "(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs" and "Cooties," aren't missed at all; the first is the closest thing to a clinker in the show, an uninspired attempt to musicalize the comic villainess Velma Von Tussle". CinePhillyist described it as "Michelle Pfeiffer's funny and more than a little dirty [number]". Similarly, EY Jacksonville called it "one of the funniest numbers in the show". IndyWeek commented "This show that features a number titled "The Legend of Miss Baltimore Crabs" had earned a standing ovation from a room ranging from children to the elderly. That's an achievement that Waters himself would approve." Reviewing Pfeiffer's performance in the 2007 film, Phawker wrote "Her fab rendition...commands your attention. Keeping Up With NX said "we even get so see Velma in all her crowning glory with the hilarious ‘(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs.’".
1593	Although the song never appeared in the film, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, there is disagreement about whether the song had been intended to appear in it. Nevertheless, Pitney has stated that the song's recording session was paid for by Paramount, and that it was midway through the song's recording session that he found out that the song was not going to be included in the film, when one of the orchestra members told him that the film had been released.  Session drummer Gary Chester plays on the recording.
1594	"(The System of) Dr. Tarr and Professor Fether" is a 1976 single by The Alan Parsons Project which first appeared on their album Tales of Mystery and Imagination: Edgar Allan Poe. The single reached number 37 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number 62 in Canada. Like the other songs on the album, it is based on a story by American author Edgar Allan Poe, in this case "The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether" (1845); the song was written by Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson, and was originally recorded at Abbey Road Studios, London in September 1975. The 1987 reissue featured a "cathedral organ".
1595	The full-length version was released as a single in several countries including Australia, where it became a hit, reaching No. 8. It also made Billboard Magazine's "Hits of the World" chart in both Mexico and Japan, reaching the Top 20 in Japan and the Top 10 in Mexico.  It is still played on many oldies radio stations. An Italian version of the song was featured on a Monkees compilation album. Ray Stevens did his take of the Monkees Theme on his 1985 album He Thinks He's Ray Stevens featuring a male German group of singers, Wolfgang and Fritzy, that are arguing during the refrain of the song. ("Hey Hey Bist Du Monkees".)
1596	Actress Barbara Parkins, who starred in the motion picture, suggested that Warwick be considered to sing the film's theme song. The song was to be given to Judy Garland, who had been fired from the film. Warwick performed the song, and when the film became a success in the early weeks of 1968, her single of the film theme became a million-seller, peaking at #2 for four weeks on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 (kept out of the first position by "Love is Blue" by Paul Mauriat and "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" by Otis Redding) and #1 on 4 March 1968 on WLS.  It also reached #2 on the Easy Listening charts in early 1968, #2 on the Cash Box Top 100 and #1 on the Record World chart.  The song was the B-side of another million selling tune composed for Warwick by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, "I Say a Little Prayer," which had hit #4 on Hot 100 on 9 December 1967.  The single would become one of the biggest double-sided hits of the rock era.
1597	Warwick re-recorded a Pat Williams-arranged and Burt Bacharach-produced version of the theme at A&R Studios in New York because contractual restrictions from her home label, Scepter Records, would not allow her version from the film to be included in the 20th Century-Fox soundtrack album. The re-recorded version became a million-seller. The RIAA-certified Gold Scepter LP that contained the hit version of the song, Dionne Warwick in Valley of the Dolls, peaked at number six on the Billboard Top 10 Albums chart, and would remain on the chart for over a year.
1598	The song was written about a year after the Royal Air Force and German Luftwaffe aircraft had been fighting over southern England, including the white cliffs of Dover, in the Battle of Britain. Nazi Germany had conquered much of Europe and in 1941 was still bombing Britain. With neither America nor the Soviet Union having yet joined the war, Britain was the only major power fighting the Axis powers in Europe (see The Darkest Hour). The American lyricist, Nat Burton, wrote his lyric (unaware that the bluebird is not indigenous to Britain) and asked Kent to set it to music. Notable phrases include "Thumbs Up!" which was an RAF and RCAF term for permission to go, and "flying in those angry skies" where the air war was taking place.
1599	British impresario Eve Taylor heard Johnson's version while on a US visit scouting for material for her recent discovery Sandie Shaw, who consequently covered the song for the UK market. Rush-released in September 1964, the song was premiered by Shaw with a performance on Ready Steady Go!, the pop music TV program. The first week after its release, the single sold 65,000 copies. Shaw's version reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart, spending three weeks at the top of that listing in November 1964, and that same month it debuted on the Billboard Hot 100. However, despite reaching the Top Ten in some markets including Detroit and Miami Shaw's version failed to best the US showing of the Lou Johnson original; the Hot 100 peak of Shaw's version was No. 52.
1600	A No. 1 hit in Canada and South Africa, Shaw's version of "...Always Something There to Remind Me" was also a hit in Australia (No. 16), Ireland (No. 7) and the Netherlands (No. 10), the track's success in the last territory not precluding hit status for the Dutch rendering by Edwin Rutten entitled  "Ik moet altijd weer opnieuw aan je denken" (No. 12). Shaw herself recorded  "...Always Something There to Remind Me" in French, as "Toujours un coin qui me rappelle", with lyrics by Ralph Bernet, which reached No. 19 in France. A cover by Eddy Mitchell was more successful, reaching No. 2 in France in April 1965 and also reaching No. 3 on Belgium's French-language chart. Shaw made a bid for a German hit as well, rendering "...Always Something There to Remind Me" as "Einmal glücklich sein wie die ander'n". It was not a success.
1601	Dionne Warwick re-recorded "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me" on 13 April 1967 in the same session which produced her Top 40 hit "The Windows of the World", and it was on the July 1967 album release The Windows of the World that the first-named track was debuted. Warwick's "(There's) Always Something There to Remind Me" had a belated single release in August 1968 as the intended B-side of the Top 40 hit "Who Is Gonna Love Me"; the first-named track received sufficient airplay to reach No. 65 on the Hot 100. Warwick's re-recording was later featured in the Black Mirror series 4 finale, "Black Museum".
1602	On the strength of the demos cut in Bristol, Byrne and Fisher were signed to EMI Records in May 1982 and the track "Always Something There to Remind Me" was cut on 1 September 1982 in a session at Abbey Road Studios produced by Tony Mansfield. Byrne would recall: "The record was recorded at Abbey Road, and we were invited to a party downstairs, with Paul McCartney and many other stars...When we returned upstairs to the studio around 1 a.m., I decided to have a go at the vocal, it was the first time I have ever recorded a vocal in one take".
1603	Released in the US in January 1983, Naked Eyes' "Always Something There to Remind Me" gradually gained attention, entering the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1983 to peak at No. 8 that June. The cachet of entering the US Top 10 allowed the single, previously overlooked in its performers' United Kingdom homeland, to make a July 1983 UK chart debut, although it only rose to No. 59. "Always Something There to Remind Me" did afford Naked Eyes' Top 10 success in other countries besides the United States: Australia (No. 7), Canada (No. 9) and New Zealand (No. 2).
1604	Music & Media wrote, "The first thing she reminds you of is all the previous versions of this Burt Bacharach & Hal David song. Spirited and dancey as it is, it doesn't make a poor figure at all." Brad Beatnik from Music Week's RM Dance Update commented, "This unabashed house cover of Dusty Springfield's 'Always Something There To Remind Me' is already on its way into the dancefloor history books thanks to its initial Hooj Choons release and its ability to whip a club into a total frenzy. Simple in its piano house format and chugging Euro rhythm, this is hardbag house at its purest and most joyful." Another editor, James Hamilton noted, "Vannessa calmly croons the title over piping wheezy organ and plonking piano in [a] naggingly effective simple jiggly chugging 0-129.7bpm [track]".
1605	The song also had received worldwide success. The song debuted at number 32 on the Australian singles chart, and after eight weeks in the charts, it peaked at number 11. It stayed in the charts for 19 weeks, and was certified Gold, selling over 35,000 copies in the country. The song debuted at number 48 on the New Zealand Singles Chart. After two weeks, the song jumped from number 38 to number 9, and after two weeks in the top 10, dropped to number 12; however, the next week, it re-entered the top 10, and after five weeks ascending the top 10, it reached its peak of number 3. It then stayed another two weeks in the top 10 before slowly dropping down the chart, staying 18 weeks total on the New Zealand chart. Half of those 18 weeks were spent in the top 10, and the song was certified Gold, selling over 7,500 copies there. The song also peaked at number 2 for four weeks in Norway and stayed on the country's chart for 16 weeks.
1606	"(They Long to Be) Close to You" is a song written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The most well-known version is that recorded by American duo The Carpenters for their second studio album Close to You (1970) and produced by Jack Daugherty. Released on May 14, 1970, the single topped both the US Billboard Hot 100 and Adult Contemporary charts. It also reached the top of the Canadian and Australian charts, and peaked at number six on the charts of both the UK and Ireland. The record was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in August 1970.
1607	The song was first recorded by Richard Chamberlain and released as a single in 1963 as "They Long to Be Close to You". However, while the single's other side, "Blue Guitar", became a hit, "They Long to Be Close to You" did not. The tune was also recorded as a demo by Dionne Warwick in 1963 and re-recorded with a Burt Bacharach arrangement for her album Make Way for Dionne Warwick (1964), and was released as the B-side of her 1965 single "Here I Am". Dusty Springfield recorded the song in August 1964, but her version was not released commercially until it appeared on her album Where Am I Going? (1967). Bacharach released his own version in 1971. But the version recorded by Carpenters with instrumental backing by L.A. studio musicians from the Wrecking Crew, which became a hit in 1970, was the most successful.
1608	"(Till) I Kissed You" is a song written by Don Everly of The Everly Brothers. It was released as a single in 1959 and peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100.  Chet Atkins played guitar on this record and Jerry Allison played drums. Recorded 7 July 1959 at RCA Victor Studio, Nashville, Tennessee, and issued as a single (Cadence 1369) July/August 1959 coupled with ‘Oh, What A Feeling’. Don Everly (guitar); Phil Everly (guitar); Chester B. “Chet” Atkins (electric guitar); Sonny Curtis (guitar); Floyd T. “Lightnin’” Chance (bass); Jerry “J.I.” Allison (drums); Floyd Cramer (piano). Producer: Archie Bleyer.
1609	(Turn On) The Music Machine is the debut album by the American garage rock band the Music Machine, and was released on Original Sound Records on December 31, 1966. It arrived just months after the group's hit single, "Talk Talk", propelled to number 15 on the national charts. Although the album was hastily recorded to capitalize on the Music Machine's popularity, (Turn On) The Music Machine managed to become a moderate hit on the Billboard 200, and is hailed today as a classic garage rock piece. Another single, "The People in Me" was also released in support of the album.
1610	Fronted by their innovative songwriter and lead vocalist Sean Bonniwell, the Music Machine became a radio favorite as a result of their rebellious proto-punk song "Talk Talk", which reached number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100 in mid-1966. "Talk Talk", along with the B-side "Come on In", was rigorously rehearsed by the group under the instruction of Bonniwell, who held a virtue to perfecting a uniquely hard-edged sound for the band.  By the time the Music Machine entered RCA Studios to record the two songs, they were well-practiced and completed them in only a few takes. Hoping to capitalize on the band's sudden success, their record label Original Sound hastily summoned the members back into the studio to record for (Turn On) The Music Machine.
1611	The album includes five cover versions -- "Cherry, Cherry", "Taxman", "See See Rider", "96 Tears", and "Hey Joe"—that were recorded for a local dance club in Los Angeles called 9th Street West, but were never intended to be featured on (Turn On) The Music Machine. However, the group's record producers insisted that the songs would improve record sales, a decision that Bonniwell recalled made him feel "artistically crest-fallen and infuriated". Still, Bonniwell regarded the Music Machine's arrangement of "Hey Joe" as innovative, invoking a slow, moody nuance that is strikingly similar to Jimi Hendrix's more well-known version. All of the remaining tracks were penned by Bonniwell, including the melodically complex "Trouble", the reflective ballad "Some Other Drum", which hinted at the musical direction the group would later take, and "Wrong", a song written in a similar style to "Talk Talk". Perhaps the most accomplished piece other than "Talk Talk" is "Masculine Intuition". Bonniwell explained the song is "very tricky for non-musicians.  They really can't quite figure out what it is...I've had other musicians tell me, their bands have tried to play that song, and they can't.  There's two sections--it's called a turnaround, and I invert two chords.  And if you don't pick up on it, there's no way you can play the song".
1612	(Turn On) The Music Machine was released on December 31, 1966 and reached number 76 on the Billboard 200. The Music Machine's second single from the album, "The People in Me", was distributed in January 1967, and managed to chart at number 66.  Over the years, the album has been considered a garage rock classic, with Guitar magazine ranking it at number three in its category of "100 Essential Garage Rock Albums". Music historian Richie Unterberger, writing for the Allmusic website, gathers that (Turn On) The Music Machine is highlighted by Bonniwell's original material, and "would have been a lot better if they'd let Sean Bonniwell write all of the songs". Critic Doug Sheppard praised Bonniwell's lyrical style, saying it "transcends the typical boy-girl theme of the day by instead favoring more introspective, psychological matter". In his article The Psychedelic Experience, Brian Hogg wrote the album "naturally features the group's hit single, as well as its flipside, the moody 'Come on In'. But alongside these tracks were five equally excellent Sean Bonniwell originals, as well as five covers" that the author goes on to conclude were "all rather offbeat and idiosyncratic choices". In 1983, Big Beat Records reissued the album, and in 2006 its material was released on the record label's compilation album The Ultimate Turn On.
1613	The UICC with the SIM or USIM application plays an important role in mobile telephony as it is the secure element identifying a subscriber in the network and allowing MNOs to bill the respective account. Hence it is crucial to have standardised features e.g. placing phone calls or sending SMS working throughout the global network with all available handsets and (U)SIM cards resp. UICCs. Developing globally applicable standards for communication technologies is the task of standardisation bodies such as ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute, 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) and 3GPP2 (Third Generation Partnership Project 2). In case of the (U)SIM interface, the most important specifications are:
1614	Before mobile network operators select new handset types to be offered to their customers, they want to be sure the new handset will support all features and work in combination with new and existing UICCs. Hence, they request the manufacturers to perform those test cases defined by the standardisation bodies. Therefore, certification organisations such as the GCF (Global Certification Forum), CCF (CDMA Certification Forum) and PTCRB (PCS Type Certification Review Board) have been founded. These organisations are associations of the leading network operators, device manufacturers and other stakeholders such as test system suppliers and test houses. They select relevant test cases and define an independent certification programme for handset type approval.
1615	Set in the artsy Chelsea, this satirical film centers on a young bohemian avant-garde composer Adrian (Goldberg), who becomes involved with a trendy New York art gallery owner, Madeleine (Shelton). Adrian is a composer who makes music by breaking glass and kicking metal buckets. In contrast to Adrian is his brother Josh (Bailey), a successful painter who happens to bring Madeline to one of his brother's concerts. Madeleine is immediately drawn to Adrian's work and invites him to perform at her gallery and into her bedroom. Eventually, Josh discovers the secret relationship between Madeleine and Adrian, and the fact that Madeleine has been using Josh's paintings, which have commercial appeal, to keep the gallery running while it features more avant-garde work.
1616	The film received generally mixed reviews from critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 65% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 5.99/10. The site's critics consensus reads, "This satire on the art world is at times both clever and shallow, but its top-notch cast generates plenty of goodwill." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly wrote "The whole cast is museum quality, music and the performances are pitch-perfect in their dissonance. Gary Goldstein of Los Angeles Times called the film "Ace in the best movie satires, there's a solid core of truth Informing director Jonathan Parker's (Untitled), which takes on the New York art and music worlds smart and funny in one swoop." Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, "If (Untitled) shrewdly hedges its bets about the value of it all, it is ultimately on the side of experimental music and art and their champions, no matter how eccentric. For that alone this brave little movie deserves an audience." The film also received bad reviews like that of Kevin B. Lee Time Out New York in which he wrote "(Untitled) 's onslaught of self-indulgent bohos and art-vs.-commerce clichés are as ersatz as their objects of scorn."
1617	Untitled, more commonly referred to as The Blue Lady, 1999–2002, is a carved teakwood, metal, and indigo sculpture by Mumbai-based artist Navjot Altaf. The artwork represents a goddess of fertility and is painted bright blue, a traditional Hindu colour symbolizing divinity. The larger than life sculpture is also an illustration of the "challenges faced by women who try to claim recognition for their knowledge in parts of India." This contemporary South Asian work can be seen in the  Sir Christopher Ondaatje South Asian Gallery of The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Notably, the sculpture is listed as one of the ROM's iconic treasures and has been considered to be one of the most important pieces in the museum's collection of South Asian art.
1618	In 2003, (Untitled) The Blue Lady was exhibited at Talwar Gallery in New York City, which currently represents Altaf, in her first solo exhibition in the United States entitled In Response To.... The sculpture was installed alongside other human figures, similar in their monumental scale and brilliant indigo color, in what was an almost theatre-like setting; together, the solid, confident female figures became iconic presences, whose insistent physicality worked to "subvert...the narrative of patriarchal dominance and transcending the modes of art practices." The exhibition was instrumental in illuminating the gender-based concerns of Altaf's work, which questions the accepted language of eroticism, sexuality, and domesticity through the creation of figures, like (Untitled) The Blue Lady, of anomalous femininity.
1619	Altaf started off by drawing the figure, then used clay to model it. The final sculpture, based on the clay model, is carved out of teakwood. Since it was not possible to carve the entire sculpture from one piece of wood, Altaf carved the torso and head as one piece, while the arms and legs have been carved separately. The body of the sculpture is not clothed, but bare. Her hands are stretched in mudra; one fist clenched, thumb outside fist, and the other hand open.  This symbolizes that she has knowledge in the grasped hand, and has the ability to receive more, while also dispersing information with the other open hand. The Blue Lady sits atop a vintage bottle drying rack; the inspiration for which Altaf drew from artist Marcel Duchamp's readymades, specifically his first readymade, the bottle drying rack.
1620	Unlike many of the other documented recordings of this group, the material, with the exception of the closing track, consisted entirely of (at the time) recently composed pieces. Since much of Braxton's writing in the early '90s involved the exploration of very fluid and expansive sound territories, there are none of his infectious, bop-derived numbers or any plaintively emotional ballads. Instead we have a series of fairly knotty compositions where the thematic elements are elusive, recurring melodies rare and regular meter almost non-existent. All of which makes for one of the more challenging recordings by this quartet, requiring of the listener an approach perhaps more suited to contemporary classical music than to jazz.
1621	Upon its release, Anna Martin of Number One stated: "Reminiscent of the classic sound of "Grey Day" and "The Sun and the Rain", the chorus follows in the great tradition of sing-a-long-ability and ends in a big, sweeping crescendo that signals the end." Simon Mills of Smash Hits related the song to the band's recent material of that time: "Their "farewell single" is more of the same doomy stuff about an unfortunate bunch of folk who are all waiting for this train that never comes. Life's like that isn't it?"
1622	"(We've Got) Honey Love" is a 1967 song by Motown girl group The Velvelettes that later became a 1969 single released by another Motown girl group Martha and the Vandellas (credited here as Martha Reeves & the Vandellas) from their album Ridin' High released in 1968.  The song returned the Vandellas to the top forty of Billboard's R&B singles chart where it peaked at number twenty-seven while it hit the Billboard Hot 100 peaking at number fifty-seven. It was the group's sixth record where they were listed as Martha Reeves and the Vandellas following the successful "Honey Chile" single two years earlier. The song talked of how one woman's lover's charm was like "sugar and spice" adding names of candy and soda adding "a little bit of me, a little bit of you and we've got honey love." The Velvelettes, meanwhile, had recorded two versions of the song (one led by the group's lead singer, Carolyn 'Cal' Gill, the other is a rare lead for then group member - and future Vandella - Sandra Tilley), both of which would go unreleased for almost 40 years. All three versions were written by Richard Morris and Sylvia Moy, and produced by Morris (with Moy co-producing the versions by The Velvelettes). Every version also used the same track with The Andantes as background vocals.
1623	"(We All Are) Looking for Home" was recorded and released to raise awareness of Lisa Vanderpump and her husband Ken Todd's Vanderpump Dog Foundation. Speaking about the campaign, Todd said, "It is our vision that this song will represent a movement to a more humane world for dogs everywhere and symbolize the global outcry for change." Vanderpump expressed her excitement at working with Lewis and Warren, adding, "We are very excited to be working alongside such innovative women like Diane and Leona. They are just as passionate about this campaign as we are, and we truly appreciate their support. The song supported the Stop Yulin Forever campaign in particular, which advocates for the end of the Lychee and Dog Meat Festival. The festival, which takes place in June each year, sees up to 10,000 dogs and cats slaughtered for their meat.
1624	During the week of September 16th, Nexus gained recognition from online dance music radio station Fusion Radio after "It Feels So Good (Flatdisk Electro Mix)" hit #3 on the "Fusion Top 100" list. In the same week, Nexus became the #1 Breakout Artist of the Week on the Billboard Hot Dance/Club Chart beating out nationally recognized "Foxes" for her collaboration with DJ and Producer Zedd. After becoming the #1 Breakout Artist of the Week on Billboard, Nexus made their debut on Billboard Dance Club Songs at #42 on the week of September 23 and rose steadily in the weeks following.  Nexus also debuted on the Top 50 of Billboards Dance/Electronic Songs the week of October 26, 2013.
1625	With a passion for recording his own instrumental style of music out of high school, Gunn has enjoyed a successful twenty-year career in world music under the name Nicholas Gunn.  He has recorded and produced fourteen albums in this genre and is a double platinum artist. He has also been on the Billboard New Age charts for fifty consecutive weeks with his albums, "The Sacred Fire," "The Music of the Canyon," and "Thirty One Nights."  Gunn also owned and operated his own record label, Gemini Sun Records, which represented over seventy five artists worldwide and grew to be one of the top New Age music labels. Gemini Sun closed in 2009.
1626	Carmen Rainier was born in Scarborough, ME.  Upon moving to Southern California at the age of nine, she began acting, forming a teen acting group in Los Angeles during high school and acting in local community productions such as Tony Kushner's Angels in America. Leaving college after her sophomore year, Rainier spent most of her twenties traveling, having visited nearly twenty countries and living abroad in Spain, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. She eventually returned to the U.S. in 2010 and moved to Santa Barbara, CA to complete a degree in Global Studies from the University of California, Santa Barbara. It was during this time that Rainier began singing seriously and when she began working with Gunn.
1627	The song garnered mainly positive reviews from music critics. Many critics called it a "fun", "terrific" and "a summer anthem". "(We Do It) Primo" failed to become a commercial success, but it did gain Carr the number one spot on Billboard's "Uncharted Chart". A corresponding music video for "(We Do It) Primo" was directed by Nate Weaver. The purpose of the video was to introduce Carr to the public.  The song was promoted through its music video being played on Teen Nick and MTV. The song is also the closing number of Carr's act in "The Cherrytree Pop Alternative Tour". The tour came to various different countries.
1628	“(We Do It) Primo” was met with mainly positive reviews. Freewired.com called it “an addictive summer-y beatThe Prophet Blog gave the song a mixed review saying, “the hook is a total earworm” and called Carr “a badly dressed Ke$ha”. He did, however called the song's melody “uplifting”.Popjustice.com called it "various types of brilliant"TotallyVivid.com said that sampling a Keane song could but dangerous, but Primo " cleverly only uses the briefest of moments of the song, cherry-picking the catchiest hook of the chorus."MostlyJunkFood.com gave it 5 stars and called it "addictive".The song led Carr to be compared to various other women in the music industry, including Nicki Minaj, Ke$ha, Lady Gaga, Fergie, and Katy Perry.
1629	The music video for "(We Do It) Primo" was directed by Nate Weaver. The video starts with Carr in her neighborhood, singing the song. In the background are different people riding bikes and skateboards. Frankmusik makes an appearance in the video as one of these people. Carr goes onto various green screens and different effects that represent the lyrics flash up on the screen. During the bridge of the song, Carr crawls through a white tent filled with glowing lights. Then, the tent closes and we see Carr open the curtain to a stage and is seen wearing a glittery body-suit, dancing with different background dancers behind her. After the dancers leave, Carr flashes two sparklers at the camera, while dancing. The video finishes with her blowing out the sparklers. The main purpose of the video was to introduce Carr and her unique style.
1630	The video for "(We Do It) Primo" was premiered on Vevo on May 18, 2011. Colette Carr called the video "purposly sloppy". MusicIsMyKingSizeBed.com called the video "freshy fresh" and called Carr "a star in the making."Like the song, the video was given positive reviews. BestInNewMusic.com said "Dunno which I like better the song or the video!"BlastThatBoombox.com said that "There really is no storyline which doesn't even matter because the song doesn't need one. The ending was a nice twist with Colette going under bed sheets to her hip underground place."
1631	"(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" is a song by British synth-pop band Heaven 17. It was their debut single, released on 6 March 1981, also acting as the lead single from their debut studio album, Penthouse and Pavement (1981). It was a minor hit in the UK in 1981, despite being banned by the BBC. It was also a minor dance hit in the US. It developed from an instrumental, "Groove Thang", that Martyn Ware and Ian Craig Marsh created earlier that year for Music for Stowaways, an album they released under the British Electric Foundation name.
1632	In the lyrics fascism and racism are described in an ironic fashion, using the lexicon of funk music. The lyrics of the song also reference the UK and US political leaders of the time, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan, respectively, and include denunciations of both racism and fascism.According to the book Banned!: Censorship of Popular Music in Britain, 1967-92, the song was banned by the BBC due to concerns by Radio 1's legal department that it libelled Ronald Reagan as he was the U.S. president at the time of the song's release.
1633	Despite being banned by the BBC, "(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" reached number 45 on the UK singles chart. It debuted on that chart on 21 March 1981 and peaked one week later. The single peaked at number 72 in Australia, and was a minor dance hit in the U.S., reaching number 29 on the Billboard Dance Music/Club Play Singles chart in 1981.The song was ranked at number 4 among the top 10 "Tracks of the Year" for 1981 by NME. Allmusic reviewer Stewart Mason describes the song as "clattering and jangled", with multiple electronic rhythm tracks played simultaneously, making the song seem faster than its nominal tempo."(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang" has appeared on over a dozen 1980s music and dance music compilations, including Rhino Records' Postpunk Chronicles and Just Can't Get Enough: New Wave Hits of the '80s compilations.
1634	The single version of "(We Want) The Same Thing" is drastically different from the original version found on the album Runaway Horses. While the album version has a heavily accented punk rock staccato sound, the single version was changed into a powerful pop anthem; one of her most successful to date. The intro of the single version is notable for its chants of 'Hey!' repeated four times before a drum piece introduces the song. In the Runaway Horses album booklet, the lyrics listed for "(We Want) The Same Thing" vary from the actual version on the album though they match the lyrics for the single version.
1635	Lowe has not released a solo studio version of the song, but plays it regularly in concert, and live versions have appeared as B-sides of his 1982 double single "My Heart Hurts", and his 1994 EP True Love Travels on a Gravel Road, on the radio compilations KGSR Broadcasts Vol. 3, Q107's Concerts in the Sky: the Campfire Versions, and Live at the World Cafe 10th Anniversary, some with solo acoustic guitar and some with different full bands. Another live Lowe version appeares on his 2004 live album Untouched Takeaway, and a live Brinsley Schwarz version is included on What IS so Funny About Peace Love and Understanding?, which featured songs played live in BBC sessions. Lowe also produced a cover version of the song as a B-side for the 1991 single "See Saw" by the British band the Katydids, after producing their eponymous debut album.
1636	It was [Costello's] idea. I produced his records back then. ... He was a fan of a band I was in before Rockpile, called Brinsley Schwarz. He used to come see us play. 'Peace Love and Understanding' was a Brinsley Schwarz song. When the Brinsleys broke up, like all groups, most of the songs sort of go into the dustbin, metaphorically speaking. And that was kind of one of them. But it was he who really popularized that song. It's been covered by loads of people, and it would've disappeared if it wasn't for him.
1637	When the song became a hit, it was quickly appended as the last track to the US edition of Costello's album Armed Forces. It has appeared on most of Costello's "Best of..." compilations over the years, as well as on the soundtrack to the film 200 Cigarettes. Live versions appeared on Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Volume 7: 2002–2003, and 2012's The Return of the Spectacular Spinning Songbook, both by Elvis Costello and the Attractions. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked this version of the song as the 284th-best song of all time.
1638	A version of the song was included on the soundtrack album for the film The Bodyguard, which sold 17 million copies in the United States alone. This version was performed by jazz singer Curtis Stigers (who also used it as a B-side to the single "Sleeping with the Lights On" from his eponymous debut album, which had been released the previous year) and produced by Danny Kortchmar. According to Will Birch's book on pub rock, No Sleep Till Canvey Island, the cover royalties from Stigers' version of the song made Lowe wealthy. Lowe, however, asserts that he used most of the money to support a subsequent tour with full band. Stigers later covered a second Lowe song, "You Inspire Me", on the 2003 album of the same name.
1639	In May 2020, during the corona pandemic, Sharon Van Etten and Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme released a cover of the song acompanied by an official video which was shot at the artists' respective homes. "We wanted to share something personal and universal. That we are all in this time together", Van Etten wrote about the cover. Van Etten in seen performs in her garden as her child plays in the background. Homme performed the song while sitting on a staircase and later in one of his house’s bedrooms. The musician's children also appear in several scenes. The visuals of the video was created by Matthew Daniel Siskin "via iMessage + telephone", with co-directing duties coming from "all the kids".
1640	(What's the Story) Morning Glory? is the second studio album by English rock band Oasis. Released on 2 October 1995 by Creation Records, it was produced by Owen Morris and the group's guitarist and main songwriter Noel Gallagher. The structure and arrangement style of the album were a significant departure from the group's previous album Definitely Maybe (1994). Gallagher's compositions were more focused in balladry and placed more emphasis on "huge" choruses, with the string arrangements and more varied instrumentation contrasting with the rawness of the group's debut album. Morning Glory was the group's first album with drummer Alan White, who replaced Tony McCarroll (though McCarroll still appeared on the album, drumming on the track "Some Might Say").
1641	The record propelled Oasis from being a crossover indie act to a worldwide rock phenomenon, and is seen by critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music. Morning Glory sold a record-breaking 345,000 copies in its first week in the UK, spent 10 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart. It was also the band's breakthrough in America, reaching number four on the US Billboard 200 and being certified 4× platinum there. The album yielded four major hit singles in the band’s native Britain: "Some Might Say" and "Don't Look Back in Anger" reached number one, and "Roll with It" and "Wonderwall" peaked at number two. "Champagne Supernova" and "Wonderwall" reached number one on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart. At the 1996 Brit Awards, the album won Best British Album. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band supported the album with an extensive world tour, which saw them play to among the largest audiences ever at the time.
1642	Although a commercial success, the record initially received lukewarm reviews from mainstream critics; many reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. However, critical opinion towards the album completely reversed in the ensuing years, and it is now generally considered an important record of both the Britpop era and the 1990s in general, as well as appearing on several lists of the greatest albums in rock music. At the 2010 Brit Awards, Morning Glory was named the greatest British album since 1980. It has sold over 22 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. As of October 2018, it is the UK's fifth best-selling album and third best-selling studio album of all time, having been certified  15× platinum and selling 4.94 million copies. It was also the UK's best-selling album of the 1990s.
1643	In May 1995, in the wake of the critical and commercial success of their 1994 debut album, Definitely Maybe, Oasis began recording Morning Glory at Rockfield Studios in Wales, with Owen Morris and Noel Gallagher producing. By the time they had finished in June 1995, Oasis were on the brink of becoming one of the most popular bands in the UK; the August 1995 "Battle of Britpop" incident in which Oasis and Blur had a chart battle over their respective singles "Roll with It" and "Country House" would propel them to mainstream awareness.
1644	Despite the friction between the Gallagher brothers, Owen Morris reflected in 2010 that: "The sessions were the best, easiest, least fraught, most happily creative time I've ever had in a recording studio. I believe people can feel and hear when music is dishonest and motivated by the wrong reasons. Morning Glory, for all its imperfection and flaws, is dripping with love and happiness." Paul Weller joined them in the studio and provided lead guitar and backing vocals for "Champagne Supernova", and harmonica for the two untitled tracks known as "The Swamp Song". Noel wrote the last song for the album, "Cast No Shadow", on the train as he returned to the studio.
1645	Morris claimed the album was recorded in 15 days, at a pace of one song a day. "Some Might Say" proved problematic to record: the backing track was recorded in one take after Noel Gallagher and Morris drunkenly listened to the demo and decided the new version was played too fast, and Noel woke the rest of the band to re-record it. The backing track was faster than intended, with what Morris described as "a really bad speed up during the first three bars of the first chorus", but the take had to be used because those involved were impressed with Liam's vocals, and Morris had to mix the track three times, using delay and other processing to hide the mistakes. When the album was finished, Morris said it would "wipe the field with any competition ... It's astonishing. It's the Bollocks for this decade." Creation Records boss Alan McGee was similarly enthused, saying that "You just cannot slag this record. It's gonna speak to real, working class lads in a way that a Suede or Radiohead could only dream of doing." The title (What's the Story) Morning Glory? was inspired by Noel's friend Melissa Lim answering the phone with said phrase, which is itself derived from a line from the film Bye Bye Birdie.
1646	The brickwall mastering technique utilised during the recording of the album has led to some journalists claiming that it was responsible for initiating the loudness war, as its heavy use of compression, first widely used by Morris on Definitely Maybe, was leaps and bounds beyond what any other album up until then had attempted. Music journalist Nick Southall, who has written extensively on the loudness war, commented, "If there's a jump-the-shark moment as far as CD mastering goes then it's probably Oasis." In Britpop and the English Music Tradition, Andy Bennett and Jon Stratton noted that as a result of this technique "the songs were especially loud. [Liam] Gallagher's voice is foregrounded to the point that it appears to grow out of the mixes of the songs, exposing itself to execute a pseudo-live quality."
1647	The music on (What's the Story) Morning Glory? has been characterised by commentators as rock and Britpop. Music critic John Harris commented in his music history Britpop!: Cool Britannia and the Spectacular Demise of English Rock that much of the music seemed to be "little more inspired than a string of musical hand-me-downs". Among the musical cues Harris noted on the album were Gary Glitter's "Hello, Hello, I'm Back Again", the theme to the 1970s children's programme You and Me and the Beatles' "While My Guitar Gently Weeps" ("She's Electric"), and the influence of R.E.M.'s "The One I Love" on "Morning Glory". One song, "Step Out", bore such a close resemblance to the song "Uptight (Everything's Alright)" by Stevie Wonder that it was removed from the album shortly before release due to the threat of legal action. In Britpop ..., Bennett and Stratton analysed Liam Gallagher's vocal style in significant detail, stressing its importance to the songs of the album; "[Liam's] Mancunian accent blends into a register and timbre that works the gestural contours of the melody and lyrics." Bennett and Stratton went on to conclude that Liam's 'over-personalized' style on songs such as "Wonderwall" resulted in "a beautiful sense of sentimentality that bespeaks the despondency of a generation. This occurs through the narrative structure of the song, vocal production, and the conventions of the singer's cultural context."
1648	Noel Gallagher summed up his own perspective on the album's aesthetic in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1995; "Whilst [Definitely Maybe] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, What's the Story is about actually being a pop star in a band." The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the rawness and edged rock of Definitely Maybe. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as "Don't Look Back in Anger" and "Champagne Supernova" was a significant departure from the band's debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, "Whatever", released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on What's the Story. In the BBC documentary Seven Ages of Rock, former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that "with Morning Glory, [Noel] began to take seriously the notion of being the voice of a generation".
1649	While "Some Might Say", a number one hit, had been released in April, the single chosen to precede the album's release was "Roll with It", planned for release on 14 August, six weeks before the album was due to hit the shelves. This was an unorthodox method for the time, contrasting the standard industry procedure of releasing the lead single three weeks before its parent album. Blur's management had become worried that this would hinder the chances of the group's forthcoming "Country House" single reaching number one the following week. As a reaction, Food Records pushed the release of "Country House" back a week and thus started what became known as "The Battle of Britpop".
1650	The event triggered an unprecedented amount of exposure for both bands in national newspapers and on television news bulletins, supposedly symbolising the battle between the middle class of the south and the working class of the north. In the midst of the battle a Guardian newspaper headline proclaimed "Working Class Heroes Lead Art School Trendies". In the event "Country House" outsold "Roll with It" by 54,000, and topped the singles chart for a fortnight. Overall singles sales that week were up by 41 percent. In 2005, John Harris reflected on the importance of the event in popularising Britpop; "(as) Blur's "Country House" raced Oasis' "Roll with It" to the top of the charts, just about every voice in the media felt compelled to express an opinion on the freshly inaugurated age of Britpop."
1651	During a promotional interview in September, the month before the album was released, Noel spoke about the rivalry with Damon Albarn and Alex James from Blur, and was quoted in 17 September edition of The Observer saying he hoped "the pair of them would catch AIDS and die because I fucking hate them two." Although Noel recanted and said that AIDS is no laughing matter, the quote caused a storm of controversy, with Noel having to write a letter of apology; he later confessed that "my whole world came crashing down in on me then". However, in an interview with The Guardian in 2005, Blur's guitarist Graham Coxon explained that he bore no malice towards Oasis. "At least they were outright about it. They weren't pretending to like us and then slagging us off, which is what we'd been used to. In that way, I quite appreciated them."
1652	(What's the Story) Morning Glory? was released on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the Daily Express reported the day after release that central London HMV stores were selling copies of the album at a rate of two per minute. At the end of the first week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 345,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind Michael Jackson's Bad. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it hovered around the top three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album did not leave the top three for an astonishing seven months. In addition, by the time of its one-year anniversary in October 1996 the album had remained in the top ten for all but one week.
1653	After the fourth single from the album, "Wonderwall", hit the top ten in several countries, including stays at number one in Australia and New Zealand and achieving a peak of number eight in the United States, the album began to enjoy prolonged international success. Eventually the album had a five-week run at the top of the Australian albums chart and an eight-week run at the top of the New Zealand albums chart before topping charts in Canada, Ireland, Sweden and Switzerland. The album was also making significant waves in the US market, thanks in part to the success of the "Wonderwall" and "Champagne Supernova" singles on American modern rock radio. Both songs reached number one on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and stayed there for ten and five weeks respectively. By early 1996, What's the Story was selling 200,000 copies a week, eventually peaking at number four and being certified four times platinum by the end of the year for shipments of over four million units. "Wonderwall" also topped the Australian and New Zealand singles charts.
1654	The band embarked on what would become a 103 show world tour in support of the album over a period of several months in 1995 and 1996. The tour started on 22 June 1995 with a pre-Glastonbury festival warm-up gig at the 1,400 capacity Bath Pavilion, which featured the debut of new drummer Alan White and several new songs off the album, and ended on 4 December 1996 at the 11,800 capacity Mayo Civic Centre in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and included concerts at Earls Court in November 1995 and Cardiff International Arena in March 1996. The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice walking out of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.
1655	In September 1995, bass player Paul "Guigsy" McGuigan walked out on the group after he was subjected to a flurry of verbal abuse from Liam while doing interviews in Paris. McGuigan cited nervous exhaustion as the reason for his departure. Scott McLeod of The Ya-Yas was brought in as his replacement; though, despite playing a string of gigs with the band and appearing in the video for the "Wonderwall" single, McLeod was unable to adapt to the frenetic celebrity lifestyle, duly returning to Manchester halfway through an American promotional tour for the album. The band played a few dates, including an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman, as a four piece, before McGuigan was convinced to return for the group's Earls Court shows in early November. When the band broke up for a brief time in late 1996, several US tour dates and the entire Australia and New Zealand leg had to be cancelled.
1656	As the band began to reach the peak of their popularity, several large open-air concerts were organized in the UK during 1996, including two gigs at Manchester City football stadium Maine Road, two nights at Loch Lomond in Scotland, and two nights at Knebworth House in front of a record 125,000 people each night; an event that would come to be acknowledged as the height of the Britpop phenomenon, with one journalist commenting; "(Knebworth) could be seen as the last great Britpop performance; nothing after would match its scale." At the time, the concerts were the biggest gigs ever held for a single band on UK soil, and to date remain the largest demand ever for a British concert; with reportedly over 2.5 million applications for tickets. The Earl's Court and Maine Road gigs were filmed and later released as the Oasis VHS/DVD ...There and Then.
1657	(What's the Story) Morning Glory? was released to lukewarm reviews from the mainstream music press. Many contemporary reviewers expressed disappointment at the album's perceived inferiority to Definitely Maybe, taking aim at the "banal lyrics" and the unoriginal nature of the compositions. David Cavanagh of Q magazine said of the lyrics: "They scan; they fill a hole; end of story. They [say] nothing much about anything." Andy Gill of The Independent commented that "She's Electric" is "laddism of a tiresomely generic kind", while "Roll with It" is "drab and chummy". In Spin, Chuck Eddy wrote that the band had eschewed the "Bowie glitter" of their debut for "generic classic rock", while Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot felt that they lacked a distinguishing "attitude" despite being "modestly tuneful". Perhaps the most damning review came from David Stubbs of the now-defunct Melody Maker. Despite stating that "Some Might Say" was "the best single of the year", Stubbs went on to be critical of the album as a whole; "What's the Story [sounds] laboured and lazy. On this evidence, Oasis are a limited band ... they sound knackered."
1658	NME was more enthusiastic, with the magazine's John Robinson writing that the album shows Oasis pursuing "an altogether different direction; away from the conscience-free overloaded hedonism towards an understanding of its consequences". Rolling Stone's Jon Wiederhorn wrote that "What's the Story is more than a natural progression, it's a bold leap forward that displays significant musical and personal growth." He went on to note that the "stormy" relationship between Liam and Noel proved to be one of the album's strengths; "tension and instability have been inherent traits of great rock teams ... for Oasis, the addition of shared genes gives their songs extra impact and dimension." Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn welcomed the album as a counterpoint to the prevailing "despair" of the decade's rock music. The album finished 10th in the voting for The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll. The poll's curator Robert Christgau initially assessed it as "phony Beatlemania"; he later gave it a two-star honourable mention, indicating a "likable effort that consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well enjoy", and quipped "give them credit for wanting it all—and (yet another Beatles connection!) playing guitars". Select ranked the album at number two on its end-of-year list of the 50 best albums of 1995.
1659	(What's the Story) Morning Glory? is considered an important record of the Britpop era and one of the best albums of the nineties, and it appears in several charts as one of the greatest albums of all time. Rob Sheffield, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), called the album "a triumph, full of bluster and bravado but also moments of surprising tenderness", adding that it "capped a true golden age for Britpop". Rolling Stone ranked the album at 378 on its 2012 list of "The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time" and at 157 on its 2020 list. The album's enduring popularity within the UK was reflected when it won the British Album of 30 Years award at the 2010 Brit Awards. The award was voted by the public to decide the greatest Album of the Year winner in the history of the Brit Awards. The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. It was voted number 21 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums.
1660	What's the Story went on to become the best-selling album of the decade in the UK, with its fifteen platinum certifications from the British Phonographic Industry. It was also certified four times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The fifteen platinum certifications in the UK were the highest ever awarded to a single record until Adele's 21, released in 2011. The success of the album resulted in Oasis becoming one of the biggest bands in the world, with substantial and considerable press coverage in the mainstream music press and frequent comparisons to the Beatles in the media. Liam and Noel Gallagher both featured prominently in gossip columns and daily tabloids throughout 1996–97.
1661	What's the Story propelled Oasis from being a crossover indie act to a worldwide rock phenomenon after the momentum gained by the critically acclaimed Definitely Maybe. It has been pinpointed by music critics as a significant record in the timeline of British indie music, demonstrating just how far into the mainstream independent music had ventured. In 2005, John Harris noted the significance of the album and "Wonderwall" in particular to Britpop's legacy. "When (Oasis) released Wonderwall, the rules of British music were decisively changed. From hereon in, the lighter-than-air ballad became obligatory, and the leather-trousers era of rock'n'roll was over." The success of the album in Britain resulted in Oasis becoming a cultural ubiquity for a brief period, featuring in tabloid newspapers on an almost daily basis and breaking sales records for live concerts.
1662	(What's the Story) Morning Glory? Tour was a world concert tour by English band Oasis in support of their hugely successful second album (What's the Story) Morning Glory?.  The tour, which spanned the UK, Europe, the US and Canada, included 103 shows over a period of several months in 1995 and 1996 amidst twelve different tour legs and several cancelled legs in the US and Australia/New Zealand. The tour started on 22 June 1995 with a pre-Glastonbury festival warm up gig at the Bath Pavilion which featured the debut of new drummer Alan White and several new songs off the album which wasn't to be officially released until early October, and ended on 10 September 1996 at the Nissan Pavilion in Bristow, Virginia, when the band decided to halt touring to focus on the recording of their anticipated third album, Be Here Now.
1663	The tour is notable for its UK summer leg of 1996 which consisted of several open-air concerts to record crowds. The tour included such venues as Maine Road in Manchester, Loch Lomond in Scotland, Páirc Uí Chaoimh in Ireland and Knebworth Park in England in which the band played to 250,000 people over two nights. Unprecedented for an open-air concert in the UK at the time, the gig also holds the record for the largest ever ticket demand in history with nearly three million (1 in 20 people) ticket applications.
1664	Whilst the tour was taking place, (What's the Story) Morning Glory? had become a worldwide success and Oasis became one of the biggest bands of the era. The Gallagher brothers regularly made tabloid headlines for their frequent fallouts and rockstar lifestyles. The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice walking out of the group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg. When the band broke up for a brief time in late 1996, several US tour dates and the entire Australia and New Zealand leg had to be cancelled. On one such occasion, Oasis were due to perform on MTV Unplugged at the Royal Festival Hall in London when Liam pulled out minutes before the group were to take to the stage; citing a sore throat as to why he could not perform. Noel had to take over lead vocals for the entire performance whilst Liam heckled him from a balcony in the crowd. The band later found out that Liam did not like performing acoustically.
1665	"(What Is) Love?" is a song recorded by American entertainer Jennifer Lopez. Originally entitled "What Is Love?", the song appeared on the soundtrack to The Back-up Plan (2010), a film in which Lopez stars, version presented in Italy at the Sanremo Music Festival 2010. The song was later included on Lopez's seventh studio album Love? (2011), as the album's title track. "(What Is) Love?" is a midtempo electropop song written by Diana "Wynter" Gordon, with the song's producer Emile "D'Mile" Dernst II. The song is about "not knowing what love is," according to Gordon. A remix of "(What Is) Love?", entitled "What Is Love? Part II", was produced by Jean-Baptiste. It was considered for inclusion on Love? and was leaked onto the internet in April 2013.
1666	"What Is Love?" was leaked onto the internet in May 2009. Wynter Gordon, the co-writer of "What Is Love?", expressed her dismay at the "unfinished and unmastered" song's leak in a post on her official MySpace blog. She stated: "I wrote this song from a deep place in my heart. If the world was gonna hear it, I wanted them to hear it right... It's as good as gone to me now... The story was given a Lifetime TV special instead of a movie... sad." Gordon did note that she was dissatisfied with the circumstances, but was in "no way dissing Lopez."
1667	The song received a positive review from Digital Spy's Robert Copsey, who although stating that it isn't any "we haven't heard before," Lopez carries "it off with her unrivalled glamour and effortless sophistication." He concluded by stating that the song was worthy of a standalone release. Monica Herrera from Billboard commented that on the song, Lopez channels "J.Lo circa 2003." Herrera added the song would have been "slayed if the gender had been flipped", and it had been sung by Justin Bieber. Joey Guerra from the Houston Chronicle said that Lopez uses "(What Is) Love?" (and the album cut "Starting Over") to play the jilted lover. Us Weekly noted the song's lyrics to be pointing "a few fingers" at Lopez's previous relationships, seen in the line dissing "blind dates" and the declaration of: "Musicians are the worst."
1668	"(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me" (known as "Give It Up to Me" in its solo version) is a reggae–dancehall song written by Sean Paul for his third album The Trinity (2005). The single meant to be released after "Temperature" was "Breakout", but was switched to "Give It Up To Me" to promote the film Step Up (2006). It is the fourth U.S. single taken from the album and the fifth UK single. It was a split single with "Never Gonna Be the Same", which was released outside the North America in June 2006 but it was finally released worldwide in October 2006. The version released as a single (the one called "(When You Gonna) Give It Up to Me", in order to differ from the album version) was a collaboration with Keyshia Cole and the song was a single from the Step Up film soundtrack. Despite The Trinity being re-released just before the single release, the version with Keyshia Cole did not make the album, despite a "radio version" being added.
1669	The score for Love Story was written by Francis Lai, and the company that published the music for Paramount felt that the track heard over the opening and closing credits, which was titled "Theme from Love Story", needed lyrics. Michael Sigman, son of lyricist Carl Sigman, recalled that his father was asked to provide the words and received "a synopsis of the script and the lead sheet of the music. The story was schmaltzy, but the music inspired words that expressed the sadness beneath the schmaltz." The initial set of lyrics his father wrote mirrored the storyline of the film from the perspective of the male protagonist, who describes a woman who enters his life ("So Jenny came") and then "suddenly was gone." Paramount executive Robert Evans "thought the lyric was a 'downer.' Further, he couldn’t abide the phrase 'Jenny came,' believing it too sexually suggestive for a mainstream audience. He demanded a rewrite," and this upset Carl. "At first, justifiably proud of the fine lyric he crafted, he was angry and felt like refusing to do a rewrite. But the next day he cooled off and, pacing around his living room, said to his wife, 'Where do I begin?' and the new lyric was launched."
1670	Before the film opened in theaters on December 25, 1970, the recording of "Theme from Love Story" by Henry Mancini was released as a single and made its debut on Billboard's Easy Listening chart in the issue of the magazine dated December 19. Two versions of "(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story"—one by Williams and one by Tony Bennett—were released on January 15, 1971, and an article in the magazine's January 23 issue tried to explain the gap between releases of the instrumental and vocal versions as intentional. The logic behind the decision was that "only the instrumental version should hit the market before the picture's release, and that the vocal version should be held up until several weeks after the film's release so that 'the theme and the image of Love Story would be implanted in the audience's mind.'"
1671	The Mancini version spent two of its 16 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number two and also began a run of 11 weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in the January 16 issue, during which time it got as high as number 13. The track that Francis Lai and his orchestra recorded for the film first charted on the Hot 100 in the January 31 issue and made it to number 31 over the course of nine weeks. It also reached number 21 on the Easy Listening chart during its five weeks there that began in the February 6 issue.
1672	The Williams version of "(Where Do I Begin?) Love Story" also debuted in the February 6 issue on both the Hot 100 and Easy Listening charts, while the Bennett version only managed to "bubble under" the Hot 100 for five weeks that began in the February 13 issue and eked out a peak position at number 114. Williams reached number nine on the Hot 100 during a 13-week stay and enjoyed four of his 15 weeks on the Easy Listening chart at number one. Roy Clark entered the Country singles chart with his rendition six weeks later, on March 27, and made it to number 74 during his two weeks there. (The flip side of Clark's single was his guitar rendition of the "Theme from Love Story"that also appeared on his 1973 album Superpicker.)
1673	The song showed considerable musical and lyrical maturity for the band at the time. Compared with their other early singles, it is stylistically more in line with their version of Junior Murvin's "Police and Thieves" as the powerful guitar intro of "(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais" descends into a slower ska rhythm, and was disorienting to a lot of the fans who had grown used to their earlier work. "We were a big fat riff group", Joe Strummer noted in the Clash's film Westway to the World. "We weren't supposed to do something like that."
1674	The song was ranked at No. 8 among the top "Tracks of the Year" for 1978 by NME. In 2004, Rolling Stone rated the song as No. 430 in its list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In December 2003, the British music magazine Uncut ranked the song No. 1 on their "The Clash's 30 best songs" list. The list was chosen by a panel including former band members Terry Chimes, Mick Jones, and Paul Simonon In 2015, the Guardian ranked it No. 2 on Dave Simpson's "The Clash: 10 of the best" list, and in 2020 it appeared in the number one position in Simpson's list of "The Clash's 40 greatest songs – ranked!" Stereogum ranked it No. 4 on their "The 10 Best Clash Songs" list.
1675	Deborah Evans Price, of Billboard magazine reviewed the song favorably, calling it a "heartbreak, pure country waltz" and saying that nobody does this type of song better than Jackson. Kevin John Coyne of Country Universe gave the song an A grade, calling it a "pure country song" due to the fiddle. He goes on to say that Jackson's "equally forlorn voice singing the opening lyrics, 'A stark naked light bulb hangs over my head, there's one lonely pillow on my double bed', serves as confirmation that we're in for 3 minutes and 30 seconds of a deliciously straight-up country weeper that turns out to be one of Jackson's most satisfying singles yet.
1676	"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman", as well as its B-side, "Low Budget", were the first songs recorded for the Low Budget album, although, unlike the rest of the album which was recorded in New York, the tracks were cut in Konk Studios. The band's recently hired studio engineer, John Rollo, said of the sessions for the two songs, "The album before [Low Budget, Misfits] was beautifully recorded, but not that rock and roll.  I think the first two songs [I did] went extremely well and the band wanted to spend some time in New York, to get away from distractions and kept it as a raw band recording."
1677	Dave Davies, initially unimpressed with the song, added guitar parts. Dave Davies also said of the song's release, "I think that one ['Superman'] was, not the biggest mistake, but it could've been one of the biggest mistakes we made. I remember I had quite a difficult time with Ray while we were making the record, because I didn't like the direction it was going. It was a strange time for music in general, anyway. The fact that it's funny, that it was a humorous song, saved it. I don't feel bad about that song at all, but it could have been a big mistake."
1678	The song also invokes another movie from the era, Saturday Night Fever, and the 1960s Animals hit "We Got to Get Out of This Place."  The lyrics describe an average person dreaming of being Superman in order to get through social issues. The lyrics combine "fantasy" and "mundanity," two of Davies' favorite themes.  Author Thomas Kitts notes the irony in the lyrics sung by a weakling wishing he were Superman which, as with other songs Davies wrote, leads to the singer feeling resigned.  Author Nick Hasted makes a similar point, that despite dreaming of being Superman, the singer remains Clark Kent and can't get over his fear of the bad news he keeps hearing. According to Allmusic critic Richard Gilliam, its lyrics are among "Ray Davies' most sharp-edged."
1679	"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman", backed with "Low Budget", was released as the lead single from Low Budget. Although it was a chart failure in Europe, the song found moderate success in North America, reaching number 41 on the American Billboard charts and number 43 on the Canadian RPM charts. Charles Aaron of Spin attributed this success to the national sentiment in the United States at the time, saying, "'Superman' caught a mood — frankly, a lot of people felt like shit at the time, and Davies' wit was more broadly accessible than on some of his earlier, conceptual set pieces". Although multiple follow-up singles were issued, "(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman" is the only single from the album to be released in both Britain and America.
1680	During the recording of Low Budget, many alternate versions of "(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman" were created, including an approximately six-minute long extended edit that appeared on a 12-inch single in America and Britain. Studio engineer John Rollo said of the many versions: "On 'Superman' we must have mixed that song at Konk [studios] twenty times - and it was quite a long song - and to get it down for a 7-inch single version we had to do twenty edits. Then we were running out of days and [Ray] had to be out of the country. Clive Davis was always known as a totalitarian hands-on guy but Ray was having none of that, he was going to make the album he wanted."
1681	Cannon wrote the song in 1902 when he was working as a bar pianist at Conrad Deidrich’s Saloon in Jackson, Michigan. Willard "Bill" Bailey was a regular customer and friend, and one night told Cannon about his marriage to Sarah (née Siegrist). Cannon "was inspired to rattle off a ditty about Bailey’s irregular hours. Bailey thought the song was a scream [i.e. very good], and he brought home a dashed-off copy of the song to show Sarah. Sarah couldn’t see the humor.... [but] accepted without comment the picture it drew of her as a wife." Cannon sold all rights to the song to a New York publisher, and died from cirrhosis aged 35. Willard and Sarah Bailey later divorced; he died in 1954, and she died in 1976 aged about 102. (See New York Times archives 1976, unknown date)
1682	Anka, whose last chart-topping hit had been 1959's "Lonely Boy", had written the song for his wife and their four daughters while appearing at Lake Tahoe. The song was going to be a solo effort by Anka, but the unknown Coates, whom Anka had met while on tour, was at the studio during the recording session. Upon suggestion by United Artists recording executive Bob Skaff, the song became a duet. Released in late June 1974, "(You're) Having My Baby" climbed the chart and became Anka's third No. 1 song. A follow-up single "One Man Woman/One Woman Man", reached the Top 10 in early 1975.
1683	Peter Reilly, in a February 1975 review of the album from which it originated, for what was then known as Stereo Review, stated that the song "defeats critical evaluation with the same brashly sure grasp of the popular mood as his equally dismal "Diana" of years ago. Everybody knows Anka can do better (he proved it easily with "My Way"), but he still composes and sings as if he were working on his first million and his fondest wish was an appearance on Dick Clark's show. "(You're) Having My Baby" is (really) The Worst. He grunts out the unforgettable lyrics, 'Yuh're havin' muh baybee/Whad a lovely way of sayin' how much yuh love me . . . Oh the seed inside you baybee/Do you feel it growin'?' in an Elvis-like roar while what sounds like Mantovani's orchestra swoons around him. Yet I'll admit, dammit, that after hearing it only once I caught myself vacantly humming it, exactly as I did years ago with "Diana". All of which probably proves that Anka has some powerful natural gift of communication no matter how much one objects to the message."
1684	The song was also criticized for declaring the child was the man's, rather than the couple's. Anka defended his choice in a 1974 interview, saying, "it's not meant to alienate anyone. I could have called it 'having our baby', but the other just sounded better. It's not a male ego trip—my baby." Anka did sometimes sing the line as "you're having our baby" while performing in concert. While reviewing a 2005 concert, Dan MacIntosh of PopMatters noted that while Anka had "covered most of his career highlights", he had "wisely neglected to include 'You're Having My Baby.'"
1685	Others criticized a line stating that while the woman could have "swept it from [her] life" (a euphemism for having an abortion, which had recently been legalized across the United States through the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling), she had not because it was "a wonderful way of showing how much she loves him". In response, Anka said the song was "a love song". He also explained in 1974, "what I'm saying in the song is that there is a choice. The libbers will get on me; I can't help that. I am into the antihuman thing, and I do understand the other side of it. There are those who can't cope, and it's not in the cards for them to have kids. I'm a libber myself, in the sense that ... if you've got to abort, you do. Some people just can't cope."
1686	This marks the first time the group's falsetto Eddie Kendricks was featured as the lead on a single, bass singer Melvin Franklin has a brief solo ("Ohh… better than…") just before the song outro. As the song's narrator, Kendricks tells the woman he loves how much he's devoted to her, and that he'll love "better than anyone before". Previous singles featured Paul Williams as the main lead, while Kendricks had only recorded a few lead lines (usually on the bridge), ad-libs and harmony vocals on some recordings.  After the failure of their first two singles, Gordy decided to try a go in a different direction with the group, writing a smooth mid-tempo balland and assigning Kendricks to the lead. As the Tempts were to be the new label's anchoring act Gordy assigned them its first single.
1687	Written by Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr., the single was The Temptations' first to appear on the Billboard R&B singles chart, peaking in the Top 30 at number 22. Although the single failed to make the Billboard Hot 100 chart, it was a strong regional smash hit in many different areas of the country, and its notable charting on the R&B charts Top 30 was enough to land them a spot on the Motortown Revue. They would later perform a live version for the Motortown Revue Vol. 2 live album. It was also because of this single's minor success that Kendricks would be given the leads on all remaining singles released that year.
1688	"(You're My) Soul and Inspiration" is a song by American pop duo the Righteous Brothers. It was the group's first hit after leaving their long-time producer Phil Spector. The song was written by Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, who also wrote the group's first hit "You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'" along with Phil Spector.  It is the title track of their album.  The single peaked at No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot 100, and reached No. 15 on the UK Singles Chart. Billboard ranked the record as the No. 3 single for 1966.
1689	The song was arranged by Jack Nitzsche who had arranged many of Phil Spector's records, and Medley produced the song in style not different from the sound of the group's early hits with Spector.  Medley was able to imitate Spector's "Wall of Sound" technique with reverbing pop-orchestration and soaring female back-up choir.  Some of the session musicians from the Wrecking Crew, such as the keyboard players Don Randi, pianist Michel Rubini and bassist Jimmy Bond, were hired for the recording. Other musicians on this record included Art Munson on guitar, Michael Patterson on piano, Drew Johnson on drums, Bill Baker (who also arranged the song) on sax, Dick Shearer on trombone, and Bill King, Sanford Skinner and Bob Faust on trumpets. It used a string section as well and there is a spoken section by Bobby Hatfield in the bridge.
1690	In 1989, Wash recorded a song "(You're My One and Only) True Love" as a demo, produced by David Cole who would later form the C+C Music Factory. Cole later gave the song to then-upcoming female group Seduction. The song appeared on Seduction's debut album Nothing Matters Without Love, released in September 1989, retaining the use of Wash's lead vocals and added Seduction's background vocals to the song. In addition, she was only credited for her background vocals and Cole remixed and altered Wash's lead vocals of the song to make her voice less recognizable on the song.
1691	Elvis Presley's version, one of the few songs in which he plays the electric bass, was recorded on May 3, with the vocal track added on May 9, 1957 and released on his Jailhouse Rock EP. It reached number fourteen on the R&B charts.  It later become a minor pop standard, with notable versions being performed by Buddy Holly, who included the song on his self-titled second album, and his version made the British singles chart in 1961, reaching no. 12. A 1983 re-release of the Elvis Presley version reached no. 61 on the UK singles chart.
1692	"(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You" is a 1964 R&B song by the Miracles on Motown Records' Tamla subsidiary label. It was written by Miracles lead singer Bill "Smokey" Robinson, and was produced by Robinson and Motown president/founder Berry Gordy Jr.. One of several gospel-styled call and response tunes the group issued in 1964, this song reached number 59 on the Billboard Pop chart, and the top 20 of the Cash Box R&B chart, peaking at number 12. (Billboard had temporarily suspended its R&B chart during this time.) The song was recorded on August 17, 1963, and was the group's first single release of 1964.
1693	After the million-selling success of their hit "Shop Around", Smokey and the other Miracles (Bobby Rogers, wife Claudette Robinson, Pete Moore, Ronnie White, and Marv Tarplin) recorded several tunes between 1961 and 1964, with the main theme centering on "parental advice". In this song, it is the father who is giving pearls of wisdom, advising Smokey, as the song's narrator, about the importance of "being a man", being loyal, and treating your wife or girlfriend right, despite the fact that every man has "a boy in his heart" that would lead him to do otherwise."(You Can't Let the Boy Overpower) The Man in You'.
1694	"(You Can) Depend on Me" (TAMLA 54028), was a 1959 song by Motown Records group The Miracles, which also appeared on the group's first album, Hi... We're The Miracles (released in 1961). It also appeared as the "B" side of the group's hit single, Way Over There. It was written by Motown Records' President and founder Berry Gordy and Miracles member William "Smokey" Robinson. While not charting nationally, this song was a very popular regional hit tune in many areas of the country, so much so, in fact, that it was included on the group's first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits from the Beginning, and Smokey still sings it, by request, in his live shows today.
1695	"(You Drive Me) Crazy" is a pop song recorded by American singer Britney Spears for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time (1999). Written and produced by Max Martin, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger with additional writing by Jörgen Elofsson and remix by Martin and Rami Yacoub, it was released as the album's third single on August 24, 1999, by Jive Records. It was featured on the soundtrack of the 1999 teen romantic comedy film Drive Me Crazy. The song garnered positive reviews from music critics, some of whom praised its simple formula and noted similarities to Spears' debut single, "...Baby One More Time".
1696	"(You Drive Me) Crazy" was a commercial success and peaked inside the top ten on the singles charts of seventeen countries. In the United Kingdom, it became Spears' third consecutive single to peak inside the top five, while it reached number 10 in the United States' Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number one in Belgium (Wallonia) and Iceland. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, portrays Spears as a waitress of a dance club and she performs a highly choreographed dance routine with the other waitresses. The video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special and featured cameo appearances of actors Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier. As part of promotion for the song, Spears performed the song at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It has also been included on five of her concert tours.
1697	Before recording her debut album, Spears had originally envisioned it in style of "Sheryl Crow music,  but younger [and] more adult contemporary". However, the singer agreed with her label's appointment of producers, who had the objective to target a teenage audience at the time. She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded in May 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was written by Jörgen Elofsson, while song production and additional songwriting was done by Martin, Per Magnusson and David Kreuger. Spears recorded the vocals for the song in March 1998, at Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. It was also mixed at Cheiron Studios by Martin. Esbjörn Öhrwall and Johan Carlberg played the guitar, while bass guitar was done by Thomas Lindberg. Keyboards and programming was done by Kreuger, and additional keyboards by Magnusson. Background vocals were provided by Jeanette Söderholm, Martin, Yacoub and THE FANCHOIR, formed by Chatrin Nyström, Jeanette Stenhammar, Johanna Stenhammar, Charlotte Björkman and Therese Ancker. In May 1999, Martin and Spears went to the Battery Studios in New York City, New York, to re-record the vocals of the track, due to the fact that a remixed version called "The Stop! Remix" was going to be included on the original motion picture soundtrack of the film Drive Me Crazy (1999). "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was released as a remix package as the third single from ...Baby One More Time on August 23, 1999.
1698	"(You Drive Me) Crazy" is a pop song. The song's composition follows a simple formula and infuses drums, guitar, and edgy synthesized instruments, including a recurring cowbell, and having a roughly similar sound to Spears' debut single "...Baby One More Time" (1999). According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" is composed in the key of C minor and runs through a moderately slow dance beat infused metronome of 101 beats per minute. Spears' vocals were deemed as heavily processed when compared to the ones of her previous single, "Sometimes". Her vocal range spans over an octave, from the low-key of G3 to the high-note of D♭5. The song's primary chord progression is Cm–A♭-G (vi-IV-III), with a few deviations.
1699	The song garnered positive reviews from music critics. Kyle Anderson for MTV considered "(You Drive Me) Crazy" as "a similar-sounding anthem [to '...Baby One More Time'] with some streamlined rock guitar taking center stage (there's even a solo). It's catchy enough". Spence D. of IGN considered "(You Drive Me) Crazy" a "[Max] Martin's glossy grown-up pop" song, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone called "(You Drive Me) Crazy" a "further hit" from ...Baby One More Time, along with "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" and "Sometimes". Music critic Walt Mueller wrote "When Spears starts to sing on this one, she sounds a lot like Janet Jackson". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press noted that the song and "Stronger" are "so lamely feel-good" tracks that they "could have been the theme song to a 'Karate Kid' sequel". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called it a "lightly dorky" song, and Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic deemed it as a "fluffy dance-pop at its best". In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was ranked ninth in a list of Spears' best songs. During the 2001 BMI Pop Awards, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was honored with the award of Most Performed BMI Song.
1700	While reviewing ...Baby One More Time on its 20th anniversary, Billboard's Chuck Arnold felt that "sparkling with the Midas touch of Max Martin, 'Crazy' perfectly captures the crazy giddiness of young love -- the kind that keeps you up all night". The staff from Entertainment Weekly placed it at number 22 on their ranking of Spears's songs and wrote: "highlighted by her overpronunciation of "you", bell rings, and a backup choir that turns the chorus into a massive singalong. ['(You Drive Me) Crazy'] captures Spears at full force, with a robust vocal performance and an ab-emphasizing choreographed dance, remembered best through its music video". Bustle's Alex Kritelis Reilly preferred the Stop! remix over the original album version. Nayer Nissim, from Pink News, deemed it "another perfect bit of late '90s pop. Very nearly as catchy as her debut". Shannon Barbour from Cosmopolitan opined that it was "not her best song, but it's insanely addictive". Nicholas Hautman, from Us Weekly,  deemed it the singer's ninth greatest single and said: "This quasi-dorky dance track can be easily summed up using just three words: pure ear candy". For Digital Spy's Alim Kheraj the most notable thing was the song's prominent use of cowbells; "backed up by rock guitars and flawless Max Martin production, Britney sounds confident, her vocals clear and powerful". On 2019, the staff of Billboard ranked the "Stop! Remix" as the 39th greatest song of 1999; Nolan Feeney said that although it was "hardly unrecognizable", Spears' re-recorded vocals, the song's new intro and  "her headline 'Stop!' interjection in the reimagined bridge made it something truly worth losing your mind over".
1701	"(You Drive Me) Crazy" was a commercial success. The song peaked at number two on the European Hot 100 Singles, being held off the top spot by R. Kelly's "If I Could Turn Back the Hands of Time". In the United Kingdom, it was Spears' third consecutive single to reach a top five position. The track debuted and peaked at number five on the chart issue dated October 2, 1999, and stayed on the chart for a total of eleven weeks. It was eventually certified Silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), for shipments over 200,000 units. According to the Official Charts Company, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" is Spears' seventh best-selling single in the United Kingdom, with sales over 275,000 physical units. The song peaked at number two in France and number four in Germany, being certified Gold in both countries for shipping over 250,000 units. It also peaked at number one in Belgium (Wallonia), finishing the year of 1999 as the 17th best-selling single. "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was also able to peak inside the top five in Belgium (Flanders), Finland, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland, while reaching top ten positions in Denmark and Italy. Later in 2012, the song managed to peak at number 65 in Czech Republic due to high airplay.
1702	In the United States, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" peaked at number ten on Billboard Hot 100 on the chart issue dated November 13, 1999, and became Spears' second single to peak inside the top ten in the country. On the same week, it peaked at number four on the Pop Songs component chart. On the chart compiled by RPM magazine, the song peaked at number three in Canada. However, on the Canadian Hot 100 compiled by Nielsen Soundscan, it peaked at number 13. The latter revealed that "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was the 44th best-selling single of 1999 in the country. The track peaked at number five in New Zealand, but failed to reach the top ten in Australia, where it peaked at number 12 on the chart issue dated November 12, 1999. However, the single was later certified Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), and was one of the best-selling singles of 2000 in the country. "(You Drive Me) Crazy" performed poorly in Japan, where it peaked at number 80, and stayed on the chart for two weeks only. Despite the low sales, it is Spears' 12th best-selling CD release in the country.
1703	The song's accompanying music video (which uses the Stop! Remix) was directed by Nigel Dick and filmed on June 14 and 15, 1999 at the AES Power Station in Redondo Beach, California. Spears conceptualized the video's treatment, and explained during an interview with MTV in 1999 that "it would be cool to be in a club, and we're dorky waitresses, and we break out and start dancing." At the time, Spears expected that the video would take her "to the next level". To promote the film Drive Me Crazy, actors Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan Hart were invited to make cameo appearances in the video, since the song had been included on the film's soundtrack, however, Grenier did not want to participate. Dick commented on the issue, saying, "I was given instructions to ring him up and make sure he appeared in the video. I said, 'You know what, Adrian, I just think it would be great for your career, and Britney's a great girl and she's fun to work with.' Eventually he came around." Dick also revealed that he was impressed by the singer's work ethic, adding that she "came to the set completely rehearsed." The music video premiered on MTV's Making the Video special that aired on July 18, 1999. Due to Hart's appearance in the music video, parts of it were featured in the credits of the Season 4 premiere of Sabrina the Teenage Witch, an episode that guest starred Spears.
1704	The video opens with Spears as a waitress of a dance club. She then goes with other waitresses to their dressing room, where they finish their makeup and change costumes. Spears, now wearing a sexy, green sequined outfit, goes through the corridor to the dance floor with her friends, and starts to perform a high-profile choreography, including a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's "Miss You Much" video, which Spears also referenced in live performances of the song on the "Crazy 2K Tour". Scenes of Spears singing in front of a shining orange sign with the word "CRAZY" are also seen throughout the video. On August 24, 1999, the music video debuted at number four on Total Request Live. It is the longest running by a female artist on TRL, staying on the top ten for seventy-three days. The video was nominated on the category of Best Dance Video on the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards; it lost, however, to Jennifer Lopez's "Waiting for Tonight" (1999). An alternate footage of the video can be found on the DVD of Spears first compilation album Greatest Hits: My Prerogative (2004). Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented, "the alternate audio gives the feel of Spears singing the song as a round, where the beat is in sync but one layer of her vocals is just slightly ahead of the other."
1705	Spears performed the song for the very first time at her L'Oreal Hair Zone Mall Tour in New York City, USA on July 1, 1998. As part of promotion for "(You Drive Me) Crazy"'s release as a single, Spears performed it at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards and at the 1999 Billboard Music Awards. It was also performed on five concert tours, the first being the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999). The show began with a dance introduction by Spears' dancers among smoke effects. She appeared shortly after at the top of the staircase wearing a hot pink vinyl tube top and white vinyl pants with pink knee patches. During the 2000 leg of the tour, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, Spears changed the opening sequence of the show; the show started with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which included a chair dance sequence referencing Janet Jackson's "Miss You Much" music video that ended with Spears saying "Is that the end?", quoting Jackson's phrase from the video. The song was once again performed in a dance-oriented form on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000–2001), while on the Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–2002), the performance featured Spears being captured by her dancers. "(You Drive Me) Crazy" was also performed on The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004). For the tour, the song was remixed with elements of latin percussion. "Crazy" would not be performed by Spears for another nine years until it was included on the setlist of her Las Vegas residency show, Britney: Piece of Me (2013–2017).
1706	In 2002, British nu metal band SugarComa covered "(You Drive Me) Crazy" and included it on their album Becoming Something Else. American musician Richard Cheese also covered the song in 2003 and included it on his album Tuxicity. American pop band Selena Gomez & the Scene performed a homage to Spears during their 2011 We Own the Night Tour. They performed "(You Drive Me) Crazy" along with a medley of hits that included "...Baby One More Time", "Oops!... I Did It Again", "I'm a Slave 4 U", "Toxic" and "Hold It Against Me", mixed similar to the Chris Cox Megamix included in Greatest Hits: My Prerogative. In the 2012 Glee episode "Britney 2.0", the characters of Marley Rose and Jake Puckerman performed a medley of the track with Aerosmith's "Crazy" (1993).
1707	On December 17, 1999, during the premiere of the music video for "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" on Total Request Live, Spears called the show to announce March US tour dates. The tour was designed as a continuation of the ...Baby One More Time Tour and a prelude to her future world tour. The leg's main sponsor was Got Milk?. Media director Peter Gardiner explained, "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was Polaroid and the corporation released the Polaroid I-Zone as the official camera of the tour. Spears also used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product.
1708	The stage of the (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour was similar to that of the ...Baby One More Time Tour, although much bigger. There were many special effects, including smoke machines and fireworks that erupted during the show. There was a giant projection screen that resembled the magical mirror from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Also present was a mechanical magic carpet in which Spears sat and flew over the first 100 feet above the crowd. Spears, who had five costumes changes during the show, was joined on stage by eight dancers. The setlist consisted of nine songs, seven from her debut album and two unreleased songs from her then upcoming album, Oops!... I Did It Again (2000).
1709	The show opened with a skit in which the dancers came out of lockers and stayed in the stage until a bell rang. They all sat until a female teacher voice started calling their names. After the teacher called Spears, she emerged at the top of the staircase in a cloud of smoke, wearing a top and white stretch pants, to perform a short dance mix of "...Baby One More Time". She then entered one of the lockers and appeared in another one on the opposite side of the stage to perform "(You Drive Me) Crazy". Spears briefly talked to the audience, the segment continued with performances of "Born to Make You Happy" and "I Will Be There". After a dance interlude, Spears appeared onstage sitting on the magic carpet and flew over the audience while singing "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know". When she returned to the stage, she performed another song from her upcoming album, "Oops!... I Did It Again". Spears addressed the audience again before the "Who is the Ultimate Heartbreaker?" interlude, in which her dancers picked a boy from the audience and invited him onstage. Spears took to the stage again wearing a jacket and dedicated the performance of "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" to the boy. She took off her jacket to reveal a pair of black pants that featured a sequined red heart in the back and performed "The Beat Goes On". After two interludes that presented her dancers and band, Spears appeared onstage to perform "Sometimes". The encore consisted of a dance-oriented performance of "...Baby One More Time".
1710	Jae-Ha Kim of the Chicago Sun-Times said that Spears "showed why she has got a leg up on blonder competitors such as Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore. Aguilera may have a better voice (and a Grammy to validate it), but Spears has that 'it' factor that worked for pinup queens of the past, such as Farrah Fawcett". Adam Graham of Central Michigan Life commented that "although the show was only about 10 songs long and the authenticity of her voice was in question throughout, it was really truly hard to walk away feeling anything but completely gratified". Dave Tianen of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel believed that the show "was energetic, good-humored, fast-paced and bright".
1711	The Everly Brothers recorded "(You Got) The Power of Love", written by Delaney Bramlett and Joey Cooper, in Hollywood on February 3, 1966. Session artists included Glen Campbell, Larry Knechtel, Jim Gordon and Hal Blaine. Released by Warner Brothers as a single in April 1966, this rock and roll tune was a cohesive effort and remains a favorite today. The song featured on the In Our Image album subsequently released by Warner Brothers, one of a trio of albums regarded by Don Everly as the best they recorded for the Warner Brothers label, the other two being Rock N Soul and Beat N Soul.
1712	"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)" (sometimes shortened to "Fight for Your Right") is a song by American hip hop group the Beastie Boys, released as the fourth single released from their debut album Licensed to Ill (1986). One of their best-known songs, it reached No. 7 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the week of March 7, 1987, and was later named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The song was also included on their compilation albums The Sounds of Science in 1999, Solid Gold Hits in 2005 and Beastie Boys Music in 2020.
1713	The song, written by Adam Yauch and band friend Tom "Tommy Triphammer" Cushman (who appears in the video), was intended as an ironic parody of "party" and "attitude"-themed songs, such as "Smokin' in the Boys Room" and "I Wanna Rock". However, the irony was lost on most listeners. Mike D commented that, "The only thing that upsets me is that we might have reinforced certain values of some people in our audience when our own values were actually totally different. There were tons of guys singing along to 'Fight for Your Right' who were oblivious to the fact it was a total goof on them."
1714	The music video for "Fight for Your Right" begins as a mother and father tell their two sons to stay out of trouble while they are away. When they leave, the two boys decide to have a party, hoping "no bad people show up"; this prompts the arrival of Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA at the party. The trio start all kinds of trouble within the house, such as chasing and kissing girls, starting fires, bringing more troublesome people into the house, spiking the punch, smashing things, and starting a massive pie fight. As the pie fight reaches its peak, Ad-Rock, Mike D, and MCA run away, the party having become too out of hand even for them. As the video ends, the remaining partygoers shout along to the final chorus of "party!" before hitting the returning mother in the face with a pie.
1715	Soren, whose hair was dyed blonde for the shoot, got her chance to be in the video because she was a friend of Rubin's and attended nearby New York University. "I worked hard at not getting any pie goo on me," she recalls, because the whipped cream used had been scoured from supermarket trash cans since there was no money in the budget for it. As a result, it was rancid and had a foul odor. "The smell in that room, when everyone was done throwing pies, was like rotten eggs. You wanted to throw up."
1716	Revisited acts as a sequel to the events that took place in the original music video and features Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA (played by Seth Rogen, Elijah Wood, and Danny McBride, respectively) as they get into more drunken antics, before being challenged to a dance battle by the future Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA (John C. Reilly, Will Ferrell, and Jack Black, respectively), coming out of a DeLorean. Eventually, both sets of Beasties get rousted by a trio of cops (played by the actual Beastie Boys) and taken to jail.
1717	Critics were mixed, where some praised the summer tune being catchy and easy to listen, while others felt the 90s reggae fusion sound a bit out to date. The single release also marks a soft comeback for both of them. Hasselhoff and Blümchen promoted the single with performances at the "ZDF Fernsehgarten", "Willkommen bei Carmen Nebel" and music festivals. The music video, directed by photographer Reza Norifarahani, stars Hasselhoff and Blümchen in front of a simple white background on a photoshoot and singing session having fun and mocking around, with some of the songs' lyrics popping up.
1718	When Blümchen has been asked by a fan at the program "MDR um 4 - Gäste zum Kaffee" on May 14, 2019 with whom she would love to do a duet, she said that she would love to work with MC Fitti while hinting she was already planning a duet, but she wasn't allowed to talk about it yet. Hasselhoff revealed at "Willkommen bei Carmen Nebel", that he chose Blümchen to sing the duet, when meeting spontaneously backstage at one of the 90s Festivals.  In another interview with German television channel RTL, Hasselhoff explained why he invited her to feature on the song: "Before the world-record-breaking 90s concert at the Schalke [Arena], where we both were the headliners, I had no idea who Blümchen was. But then I looked her up on YouTube and followed up on her on the internet and I found out she sold 30 million records! And when someone mentions the name 'Blümchen', you can see how people get excited. She has a sparkle in her eyes - true star quality. And Jasmin also has an enormous amount of energy, just like me!" 
1719	The music video has been directed by the photographer Reza Norifarahani, who also did promotional photoshoots, prior the video shoot, with them. The copyright in this audiovisual recording is owned by Luna Studios, along with Norifarahani, Weimar Pictures and under exclusive licence to Membran Entertainment Group GmbH. The video has been uploaded and released on July 26, 2019, on Blümchen's Official YouTube account. It solely stars Hasselhoff and Blümchen in front of a simple white background on a photoshoot and singing session having fun and mocking around, with some of the songs' lyrics popping up. The video used the Remix by Stereoact for the music video, possibly due to the more modern up-to-date tropical pop sounds.
1720	"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" is a 1967 single released by American soul singer Aretha Franklin on the Atlantic label. The song was co-written by Carole King and Gerry Goffin, with input from Atlantic producer Jerry Wexler. Written for Franklin, the record was a big hit reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and became one of her signature songs. It made history in the UK singles chart a week after her death, finally becoming a hit almost 51 years after it was first released entering at #79. Franklin also included a live recording on the album Aretha in Paris in 1968. Carole King has performed and recorded a version of the song along with Mary J. Blige, Celine Dion, and many others. At the 2015 Kennedy Center Honors, Aretha Franklin performed the song to honor award-recipient Carole King.
1721	Written by the partnership of Gerry Goffin and Carole King, the song was inspired by Atlantic Records co-owner and producer Jerry Wexler. As recounted in his autobiography, Wexler, a student of African-American musical culture, had been mulling over the concept of the "natural man", when he drove by King on the streets of New York. He shouted out to her that he wanted a "natural woman" song for Aretha Franklin's next album. Goffin and King went home and wrote the song that night. In thanks, they granted Wexler a co-writing credit.
1722	"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" was released as a promotional single by Celine Dion in November 1995 in North America and the United Kingdom. It was featured on a tribute album to Carole King, called Tapestry Revisited: A Tribute to Carole King issued on October 24, 1995. Later, Dion included this track on most editions of her 1996 album Falling into You. The track was produced by David Foster. Dion's version enjoyed a moderate success on the adult contemporary charts, reaching number 4 in Canada and number 31 in the United States. In 2008, the song was featured on the US version of My Love: Ultimate Essential Collection. When Falling Into You won the Grammy for Album of the year in 1997, the song became the first to appear on two Album of the Year winners - following Tapestry's success in 1971.
1723	On April 14, 1998, Dion, Aretha Franklin, Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Gloria Estefan and Carole King performed the song during a VH1 Divas concert at the Beacon Theatre, New York. The six vocalists were recruited by the cable music network VH1 to raise money for Save the Music, their education charity. Hyped extensively in the press, the event was a ratings winner for VH1 – so successful, in fact, that the network arranged to have the concert released on disc and tape on October 6, 1998. At that time "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman" (performed by all the divas) was released as a radio single in selected countries.
1724	"(You Want to) Make a Memory" is a song by American rock band Bon Jovi, which was released as the first single from their tenth studio album Lost Highway (2007). Written by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora and Desmond Child, it was released for radio airplay on March 20, 2007, and for download on the US iTunes Store on April 17, 2007. The song is a ballad, and was performed at several nationally-televised events in an effort to promote the single. "(You Want to) Make a Memory" peaked at number 27 in the United States, making it Bon Jovi's last single to break the Top 40 on the Hot 100.
1725	The video for the song was directed by Kevin Kerslake and shot in a bar called Layla's. Its storyline is based on the movie Ghost (1990) and is about a couple who is not together anymore. It was also inspired by the troubles Richie Sambora was going through in his own personal life at the time, such as the divorce with Heather Locklear, the custody battle in the middle of an alcohol addiction, and having lost his father to cancer. CMT hosted the exclusive on-air and wireless premieres of the video on Thursday, May 3, 2007. Video made its television world premiere on CMT's Top 20 Countdown and later bowed on CMT Mobile. The video was also available for free streaming at CMT's official website. That episode of CMT's Top 20 Countdown aired again on Friday, May 4, 2007 at 1:30 p.m. E.T./P.T.
1726	Announced as the first single from Lost Highway on March 19, 2007, the song was released to radio stations on March 20, 2007. On the same day it was put on a stream on a band's official website. In the week of March 19, 2007, there were 185,000 streams of the song on band's website. For those who pre-ordered Lost Highway from May 10, 2007, iTunes Store offered an instant download of "(You Want to) Make a Memory" and live versions of "(You Want to) Make a Memory" and "Lost Highway" recorded at the Cannery Ballroom in Nashville.
1727	Sven Philipp from Billboard gave a positive review: "Over a pulsing crescendo of acoustic guitars, piano and strings, Bon Jovi delivers his most soulful vocal in years, sounding relaxed and nostalgic as he offers '80s-soaked lines". Mike Kerwick from North Jersey Media Group stated "'Make a Memory' may not be as good as some of the band's all-time-great ballads ('Always' and "Bed of Roses" come to mind), but its steady build from beginning to end makes it worth a spin. It gets better with each progressive listen". Donald Gibson from Blogcritics said the song "covers much of the same ground, musically and thematically, as 'Bed of Roses'". Craig Semon from Telegram & Gazette called it "a well-crafted pop song that’s not afraid to be gooey and sentimental. With cushiony orchestration interspersed with sparkling guitar notes, the song builds gradually in its intensity and seductive charm". Ben Ratliff from The New York Times said that song "appeal[s] directly to a love interest; true to form, Mr. Bon Jovi employs the word 'baby' every time".
1728	The band was formed by three former members of the hardcore punk group Born Against: singer and guitarist Adam Nathanson (also ex-Life's Blood), drummer Brooks Headley (also ex-Universal Order of Armageddon) and harmonica player Neil Burke (also ex-Life's Blood).  Burke's tenure was brief, and his departure after the group's debut EP on Vermiform Records was followed by Avail singer Tim Barry joining on bass guitar in 1994.  Barry was replaced in 1995 by bassist Marty Key, known as Marty Violence, shortly before the group signed to California-based punk rock label Lookout! Records.  Headley left the group in 1997 and was briefly replaced by Jonathan Fuller (of Sleepytime Trio) and more permanently by Fred LaPier, who played with the group through their final years.  After several tours with bands such as At the Drive-In,  Avail, Peechees, Karp and The Locust, they disbanded in February 1999.
1729	According to Carl Davis, the Funk Brothers "used to come over on the weekends from Detroit. They'd load up in the van and come over to Chicago, and I would pay 'em double scale, and I'd pay 'em in cash." Similarly, two members of Motown's house session singers The Andantes, Jackie Hicks and Marlene Barrow, along with Pat Lewis (who was filling in for Andantes member Louvain Demps), performed on the session for "Higher and Higher". Drummer Maurice White (better known as a singer for Earth, Wind & Fire) also played on the recording. Motown's Mike Terry played the baritone saxophone.
1730	The song was originally written by Chess Records' in-house writers and producers Carl Smith and Raynard Miner, and initially recorded by The Dells for the label, but not released. Another writer, Gary Jackson, made some changes to the song and pitched it to Davis at Brunswick. When the singer recorded his vocal track, Davis recalls, Wilson originally sang the song "like a soul ballad. I said that's totally wrong. You have to jump and go with the percussion... If he didn't want to sing it that way, I would put my voice on the record and sell millions." After hearing Davis's advice, Wilson cut the lead vocal for "Higher and Higher" in a single take.
1731	Rita Coolidge remade the song as "(Your Love Has Lifted Me) Higher and Higher" for her album Anytime...Anywhere (1977). Her version has a more moderate tempo than that of the uptempo original, and largely omits the chorus which is evidenced only in the background vocals sung under the repetition of the first verse with which she closes the song. Coolidge and her sister Priscilla Coolidge had sung background on a version of the song for a prospective album by Priscilla's husband Booker T. Jones; when that album was shelved, Coolidge asked him if she could cut the song using his arrangement.
1732	(Z)-6-Dodecen-4-olide is believed to play a part in olfactory communication between individuals of the Columbian black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus columbianus), and is secreted into urine during a rut. (Z)-6-Dodecen-4-olide is then deposited onto the tuft of hair making up the tarsal gland of the deer, as the urine runs down the gland, during a behavior called rub-urination. Similarly, it has also been identified in secretions of the interdigital and pedal glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus) and the blesbok (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) where it is believed to play a role in carrying information about the dominance status, sex, health condition and possibly other characteristics of the animal it came from. The (Z)-6-dodecen-4-olide is replenished daily to maintain the pungent smell. It has also been isolated from Polianthes tuberosa, a perrenial plant used in the perfume industry since the 17th century for its powerful floral scent.
1733	( ) is the third full-length album from Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós, first released in October 2002. It comprises eight untitled tracks, divided into two parts: the first four tracks are lighter and more optimistic, while the latter four are bleaker and more melancholic. The two-halves are divided by a 36-second silence, and the album opens and closes with a click of distortion. Lead singer Jón Þór Birgisson ("Jónsi") sang the album's lyrics entirely in "Hopelandic", a made-up language consisting of gibberish words. ( ) reached No. 51 on the Billboard 200 and received acclaim from music critics, although some reviewers found the album weaker than the band's previous album Ágætis byrjun.
1734	The album's title consists of two opposing parentheses, representing either the album's two-halves, or the idea that the album has no title, leaving the listener free to determine it. Members of the band have referred to ( ) as Svigaplatan, which translates to "The Bracket Album". In the credits of the film Heima, it is referred to as The Untitled Album. The outside packaging of ( ) consists of a plastic protective sleeve with two parentheses cut out, revealing the image printed on the CD case underneath. There are four versions of this cover art, which consist of modified photographs of nature around the band's Mosfellsbær studio, sold in four parts of the world: Europe, the United States, Australia, and Japan. In Iceland, all four cover designs are sold. The back of the packaging shows an image of a sleepwalking boy, adapted from a photograph by John Yang. In 2011, Yang's daughter, Naomi Yang, of the band Galaxie 500, said that the band used the image without permission or payment to her father. There are no liner notes or production credits included, although packaged with the album is a booklet of twelve blank pages, on which listeners are invited to write or draw their own interpretations of the album's music. A limited edition version of ( ) released in Spain includes a 94-page book of contemporary art.
1735	( ) was co-produced and engineered by Ken Thomas, who also worked with the band on their previous album, Ágætis byrjun. This is the first album Sigur Rós recorded at their studio based in Álafoss, Mosfellsbær, a small rural town outside Reykjavík, Iceland. The band refers to the studio as "Sundlaugin", or "The Pool". ( ) includes the work of the string quartet Amiina. ( ) was given more production and recording time than Ágætis byrjun, although lead singer Jónsi considers the ( ) album "less polished" than its predecessor. He characterized the record as being "much more bare and alive and there are far fewer little slick things and much less sweet stuff." The strings of Ágætis byrjun were recorded in just two days, while two weeks were given for their recording on ( ). In addition, the former was performed by the Iceland Symphony Orchestra, while the latter was done by Amiina. Because of this, the string parts required less preparation prior to recording. The band "just let them 'jam' in the studio until everybody was happy", according to Jónsi.
1736	( ) consists of eight tracks divided in half by thirty-six seconds of silence which, in concept, replicates the separation of two sides of a gramophone record. Ironically, on the actual vinyl version of the record, the thirty-six seconds of silence occurs in the middle of side 2 (the vinyl consists of 4 sides). The first half of the album is "light and optimistic" musically, with a heavier emphasis on the use of keyboards than guitar, and the sampling of Jónsi's voice. The second half is more melancholic, playing with the emotions of the listener, as described by Jónsi. None of the tracks on ( ) have titles; band guitarist and keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson said of this choice, "we didn't want to put titles on the record just because there are supposed to be titles on the record." The songs are listed as "Untitled #1", "Untitled #2", etc., although each track has an unofficial name used by the band.
1737	Jónsi sang the lyrics of ( ) entirely in "Vonlenska" ("Hopelandic"), a made-up "language" which consists of meaningless words and syllables. Jónsi uses Hopelandic in place of songs which do not yet have lyrics, although some tracks on Sigur Rós albums Von and Takk... are only sung in the language. Its names in English and Icelandic are derived from "Von" ("Hope" in English), the ninth track on the album Von, which is the first instance in which Hopelandic is used in the band's music. The Hopelandic of ( ) consists of one eleven-syllable phrase, with various permutations and subsequent variations thereof sung over the course of the album. ( ) is made up of material that Sigur Rós had been playing live for over two years. For this reason, the band did not want to give the songs actual lyrics. Drummer Orri Páll Dýrason said of this, "[the songs] were fully formed and it would have been strange to suddenly insert lyrics into these finished products."
1738	Pitchfork placed ( ) 29th on its list of the fifty best albums of 2002, and 135th on its list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s (decade). The album also peaked at No. 51 on the Billboard 200. A music video for "Untitled #1" directed by Floria Sigismondi was released in April 2003. The video depicts a dystopian future in which schoolchildren wearing gas masks are playing amidst black snow and a red sky. In November 2003, Sigismondi's video was given the award for "Best Video" at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh, UK.
1739	( ) holds a Metacritic score of 82/100 based on twenty reviews, making it one of the thirty highest-scored albums of 2002 according to Metacritic. Daniel Becker of Dusted Magazine wrote that the album is "gorgeous music..the songs are vast, unhurried, and vivid, and that only makes them more powerful." He considers ( ) a "logical extension of Ágætis Byrjun, relying on the same interplay of instruments to create a similarly picturesque and eerily calm atmosphere." Chris Ott of Pitchfork wrote that "Sigur Rós' music has all the depth, resonance and humanity of a Brueghel landscape, and is best appreciated at loud volumes in open spaces, as a soundtrack for scenery, real or imagined." Sean Adams of Drowned in Sound said that "( ) is as pioneering, unnerving, inspiring, confusing, as lyrically anarchic as every thing that has moved the world, ever" and "why I love music, why this website has this name and why art exists. ( ) [is] yours to discover." Gavin Mueller of Stylus Magazine found that Jónsi's voice "never [has] sounded more exposed, giving [the band] a strength that Ágætis Byrjun often obscured. The final track’s ultimate climax is nothing short of harrowing, as a crashing storm of frantic drum fills overwhelms Birgisson’s urgent guitar strumming and plaintive wail."
1740	Andy Kellman of AllMusic said that with ( ), Sigur Rós made "only adjustments – no significant developments – in the group's sound" and that "The fact that the emotional extremes are few and far between makes the album difficult to wade through". Ott wrote that ( ) "doesn't shine with the same nascent glimmer as its predecessor. If the band weren't so headstrong, it wouldn't even be a consideration, but from the beginning they've claimed they would change music forever, and that this record in particular would be even better than [Ágætis byrjun]". In addition, he found the album's main Hopelandic phrase repetitive, and that ( ) lacked the innovation of its predecessor. Gavin Edwards of Rolling Stone called ( ) "impressive" but "remarkably similar" in sound; "it's just packaged more pretentiously." Ott said of the blank booklet included with ( ), "I fail to see how this tactic enriches the band's cinematic balladry", adding, "evidence that they just thought it would be cool to package the record this way is abundant". Mueller called the title of ( ) "forehead-slappingly pretentious", and considered the album's nameless tracks "a jab at Yorke-worshippers who couldn’t pronounce the Icelandic titles of Sigur Ros’s previous work anyway." In his review for PopMatters, music critic Matt Cibula wrote, "I don't think there are any real meanings to these songs, other than the ones we bring to them, each on our own", adding:
1741	A snippet from "Untitled #8" can be heard during the trailer for the Nicole Kidman film The Invasion."Untitled #7" is featured in the trailer for the 2008 video game Dead Space."Untitled #4", as well as "Svefn-g-englar" and the title track from Ágætis byrjun and a video backdrop used during a Sigur Rós concert in Los Angeles, are featured in the film Vanilla Sky. This was the first case of the band licensing their music for a movie; Jónsi allowed for it in part "because he thought the idea of Tom Cruise acting over their music was 'funny'"."Untitled #4" was played in the American TV series Queer as Folk, as well as the season 3 finale of Canadian TV series Orphan Black."Untitled #3", listed as its alternate title "Samskeyti", was used in the credits for the Gregg Araki-directed film Mysterious Skin (based on the novel by Scott Heim),in an episode from the second season of the British serial drama Skins and in the 2009 film The Boys Are Back (directed by Scott Hicks and starring Clive Owen) during the final shots. Various tracks off ( ) were used in the American crime drama CSI: Miami. Vaka was also heavily used in the soundtrack to the 2010 Norwegian film King of Devil's Island.The 2006 Academy Award-nominated Danish film After the Wedding also uses "Untitled #1" (Vaka) as background music during the funeral of a major character.
1742	P. Adams Sitney, Professor of Visual Art at Princeton University, wrote a short essay for Artforum International "Medium Shots: the films of Morgan Fisher" in which he describes the film "()." "Fisher's most recent film, (), succeeds astonishingly where Frampton's parallel effort, Hapax Legomena: Remote Control (1972) failed; it uses aleatory methods to release the narrative unconscious of a set of randomly selected films. () is made up entirely of "inserts" from feature films organized according to Oulipian principles. Inserts were usually shot by assistants when star actors, large crews, or expensive sets were not needed. These include details of weapons, wounds, letters, signs, tombstones, machinery, games of chance, timepieces, money, and even intimate caresses. Fisher culled the inserts from a number of films he collected for that purpose and edited them together under constraints he does not fully reveal; he places the inserts from a given film in the order in which they appeared in that film, but two inserts from the same film never follow each other directly in his assemblage. Alternating among them we catch glimpses of violence, intrigue, high-stakes gambling, and sexual adventure."
1743	According to PopMatters, "The musical marriage of Mirah and Elvrum is one of those rare perfect meeting of the minds—Jay-Z and Kanye, Butch Vig and Kurt Cobain, Phil Spector and… basically anyone who can sing. One could easily imagine Mirah being just another songwriter, singing turgid ballads about loneliness over an acoustic guitar (and indeed there is the occasional disturbing flash of this in her work), but through the intelligent production of Elvrum, and indeed, some of the other producers on (a)spera, she is able to set her thoughts upon soaring mountains of musical genius."
1744	The protein has an α/β type architecture, but the fold is unique. the active site inferred from the location of the catalytic Ser92 contains a typical nucleophilic elbow as observed in α/ β hydrolases. Serine 92 is hydrogen bonded to His 201 in a fashion similar to various serine hyrdolases. however, instead of the carboxylic acid typically found in catalytic triads, the main chain carbonyl of Gln 250 serves as a hydrogen bond acceptor in an interaction with His 201. Two other residues, Arg-117 and Glu-11 are also located in the active site, but their function is not clear.
1745	Among all known metabolic pathways in living systems, fatty acid biosynthesis yields the most energy dense products. As a result, microbial fatty acid derivatives are emerging as a promising renewable energy alternative to fossil fuel derived transportation fuels. Recently, Khosla et al. have devised a procedure to reconstitute E.Coli Fatty Acid Synthase using purified protein components (including FabD) and reported a detailed kinetic analysis of this in-vitro reconstituted system. Their finding provide a new basis for assessing the scope and limitations of using E.Coli as a biocatalyst for the production of diesel fuels.
1746	Fatty acid biosynthesis is carried out by the ubiquitous Fatty Acid Synthase. Fatty acid synthase pathways are divided into two distinct molecular forms: Type I and Type II. In Type I, Fatty Acid Synthase (found in humans and other mammals) is a single large polypeptide composed of several distinct domains. On the other hand, each enzymatic activity (Condensation reaction, Reduction Reaction, Dehydration reaction) is found as a discrete protein in type II systems. The difference in active site organization and predominance of type II FAS systems in bacteria make the enzymes of this pathway attractive targets for antibacterials.
1747	In a positive review, Heather Phares of AllMusic wrote that the album "continues the evolution of these songs as layered expressions of grief, realization, and love" and praised the live element writing that "Taking in each song as a discrete entity allows different moments to break listeners' hearts;". Ian Gormely of Exclaim wrote that the album " finds its uniqueness not in the arrangements, but in the context of the presentation" and that " we have Elverum presenting some of the rawest emotions of his life". Nathan Reese of pitchfork stated that "the most striking thing about (after) is that, even after so many performances, these songs sound as raw as they did when Elverum first committed them to paper and tape". Adam Rothbarth of Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that "this album is great. The guitar is heard clearly, and Elverum’s voice comes through on top" and that "As a performance, it’s impressive: Elverum switches between strumming chords and picking individual lines, and he does it all while effortlessly delivering his challenging lyrics and their imbalanced melodies."
1748	On December 14, 2015, BT disclosed news to DJ Mag about a new album to come by early 2016. Similar to This Binary Universe, BT explains that "the entire record is recorded in a way [I have] never recorded anything before," and that the record has a "modular, ambient aesthetic". Track names that were mentioned in the article include "Chromatophore", "Ω", "Indivism" and "582" (the names of "Indivism" and "582" were changed to "Indivisim" and "Five Hundred and Eighty Two" in the final release). On August 1, 2016, BT spoke to Mix about the album, which was recently completed. The album is intended to be named by the listeners. Additional track names that were mentioned in the article include "Artifacture", "Five Hundred and Eighty Two", and "Found in Translation". On October 10, 2016, BT announced on Facebook that the parts of the album ("Artifacture", "Indivism" and "Ω") would be released in "movements" on October 14, 2016.
1749	[(an imitation) blood orange] is the fifteenth studio album by Japanese pop rock band Mr. Children and was released on November 28, 2012. It was the band's first studio album in two years . The album [(an imitation) blood orange] consists of a total of 11 tracks, including their Triple A side single, "Inori: Namida no Kidou" /"End of the day"  / "pieces", released in April 2012, as well as "hypnosis". "Joutoku" was used as the theme song for  Ikuta Toma's drama Osozaki no Himawari: Boku no Jinsei, Renewal. and their charity digital single "Kazoe uta", released in April 2011, for victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. This album was released in two versions: a limited CD+DVD edition and a regular CD-only edition, but the same price. The limited edition comes with a DVD including the PVs for "hypnosis", "Marshmallow Day", "Inori: Namida no Kidou", and "Joutoku".
1750	The album debuted on the Japanese Oricon Chart at number one on December 10, 2012. It sold over 530,235 copies in its first week of release. This is their 15th consecutive album to top the chart, and 12th consecutive studio album to sell over 500,000 copies during the first week. In 2012, they released three albums, including Mr. Children 2001–2005 ＜micro＞ (over 716,000 copies sold in its first week) and Mr. Children 2005–2010 ＜macro＞ (selling over 732,000 copies in the first week), released back on 10 May 2012. All three albums sold over 500,000 copies in their first weeks. It makes them the first band to achieve this feat.  Mr. Children is the first group in four years who had three albums that sold over 500,000 copies in their first week of release since Exile did it in 2008 with Exile Love, Exile Catchy Best (released in March 2008), and Exile Ballad Best (released in December 2008).
1751	In mathematics, more specifically in the representation theory of reductive Lie groups, a     (   g   , K )   {\displaystyle ({\mathfrak {g}},K)} -module is an algebraic object, first introduced by Harish-Chandra, used to deal with continuous infinite-dimensional representations using algebraic techniques. Harish-Chandra showed that the study of irreducible unitary representations of a real reductive Lie group, G, could be reduced to the study of irreducible     (   g   , K )   {\displaystyle ({\mathfrak {g}},K)} -modules, where       g     {\displaystyle {\mathfrak {g}}}  is the Lie algebra of G and K is a maximal compact subgroup of G.
1752	Most tracks are unreleased recordings from Thompson's career to date - though the two instrumental tracks were recorded specifically for this compilation. (guitar, vocal) spans Thompsons's early years with Fairport Convention as well as the time he spent performing and recording as a duo with wife Linda. The release was notable for two live cuts from the 1975 Richard and Linda Thompson tour — "Night Comes In" and "Calvary Cross" — which featured lengthy guitar solos by Thompson, and for the Fairport Convention tracks "The Ballad of Easy Rider" featuring an excellent vocal from Sandy Denny which was an unreleased track from the Liege & Lief sessions and "Poor Will and the Jolly Hangman" which had been recorded for and then omitted from that group's Full House album.
1753	Most (n,p) reactions have threshold neutron energies below which the reaction cannot take place as a result of the charged particle in the exit channel requiring energy (usually more than a MeV) to overcome the Coulomb barrier experienced by the emitted proton. The (n,p) nuclear reaction 14N (n,p) 14C is an exception to this rule, and is exothermic – it can take place at all incident neutron energies. The 14N (n,p) 14C nuclear reaction is responsible for most of the radiation dose delivered to the human body by thermal neutrons – these thermal neutrons are absorbed by the nitrogen 14N in proteins, causing a proton to be emitted; the emitted proton deposits its kinetic energy over a very short distance in the body tissue, thereby depositing radiation dose.
1754	(r)Evolution is the ninth studio album by Swedish heavy metal band HammerFall. It was released on 27 August 2014 in Sweden, 29 August in mainland Europe, 1 September in the UK, and 2 September in North America. For the first time since 1998, HammerFall collaborated with Fredrik Nordström on a studio album, and Fredrik is sharing production credits with guitarists Oscar Dronjak and Pontus Norgren. It is also the band's final album to feature drummer Anders Johansson before his departure in September 2014. On 4 September 2014 (r)Evolution went all the way to No. 1 on Sverigetopplistan (Swedish Charts).
1755	(re)Production is the twenty-third solo album by rock musician Todd Rundgren that was recorded and released in 2011. For this album, Rundgren re-recorded songs that he had produced for other bands across his career, including Meat Loaf, Hall & Oates, The Tubes and Grand Funk Railroad.  (re)Production gives these songs a much more modern sheen, incorporating elements of electronic dance music and synthpop. The work was created during the MyRecordFantasy Camp sessions at the Track Shack in January 2011 arranged by the label Gigatone Records. Album packaging includes samples of cover art submissions by fans. Alternate covers were used for International, Domestic, and online versions.
1756	(sic)nesses is the fourth video album by American heavy metal band Slipknot, released on September 28, 2010. The double-disc release features a recording of their headlining performance at the 2009 Download Festival, along with a 45-minute behind the scenes documentary created by percussionist Shawn Crahan, and the four music videos from All Hope Is Gone. It is the band's first release since the death of the band's former bassist Paul Gray and is dedicated in his memory. On September 22, 2010, (sic)nesses premiered in select theaters across the United States. Entrance to the screenings were free and it included free giveaways. Reception was generally positive, with Artistdirect rewarding the album a perfect five out of five stars, and Blabbermouth.net giving the album eight and a half out of ten stars. The album peaked at number one on four charts: the Australian Top 40 Music DVD Chart, the Finland Top 10 Music DVDs, the UK Top 10 Music DVD Chart, and the US Top Music Video Chart.
1757	(sic)nesses was recorded when Slipknot headlined the Download Festival in front of 80,000 fans on June 13, 2009. The show at Donington Park was filmed with 30 cameras. The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, "Going in and filming this, it just seemed like there was no way it could fail. It was going to be in the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us  felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes".
1758	The live performance of "Psychosocial" was premiered on MSN in mid-September. The DVD premiered in a collection of theaters across the United States on September 22, 2010, prior to its commercial release. Screenings included Grauman's Chinese Theatre, Carmike Cinemas, Krikorian Theaters, Rave Motion Pictures, UltraStar Cinemas, Studio Movie Grill, Bow Tie, Santikos Theatres, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, Emagine Entertainment, Cleveland Cinemas, Cinema Café and the Regent Theater. Crahan attended the New York event on September 27 as part of the promotion. Viewings were free and several prizes were given away randomly throughout the night at all three events. Crahan stated that "(sic)nesses was one of the single hardest pieces of art for us to complete, given the circumstances..." It was mixed at Miloco Studios in London, England, and mastered at Sterling Sound in New York.
1759	The album's reception was generally positive. The album's description on Roadrunnerrecords.com stated: "The performance was absolutely electric, in typical Slipknot fashion, especially since it came hot on the heels of one of the strongest years in Slipknot's illustrious career". Scott Alisoglu from Blabbermouth.net gave the album eight and a half out of ten stars. He called it the "ultimate tribute" to bassist Paul Gray. He also noted that things like display of controlled echos, the 80,000 person audience, their energetic performances of songs from their first album, and the "unforgettable anthems" like "Before I Forget" and "Psychosocial" came together to "remind naysayers and fans alike that Slipknot has a dearth of rivals when it comes to live performance". In its first week, the album sold 9,300 copies in the United States.
1760	In calculus, the (ε, δ)-definition of limit ("epsilon–delta definition of limit") is a formalization of the notion of limit. The concept is due to Augustin-Louis Cauchy, who never gave a formal (ε, δ) definition of limit in his Cours d'Analyse, but occasionally used ε, δ arguments in proofs. It was first given as a formal definition by Bernard Bolzano in 1817, and the definitive modern statement was ultimately provided by Karl Weierstrass. It provides rigor to the following informal notion: the dependent expression f(x) approaches the value L as the variable x approaches the value c if f(x) can be made as close as desired to L by taking x sufficiently close to c.
1761	The key to the above calculation is that since     E   {\displaystyle E}  is non-zero, one can divide     f ( x + E ) − f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x+E)-f(x)}  by     E   {\displaystyle E} , but since     E   {\displaystyle E}  is close to 0,     2 x + E   {\displaystyle 2x+E}  is essentially     2 x   {\displaystyle 2x} . Quantities such as     E   {\displaystyle E}  are called infinitesimals. The problem with this calculation is that mathematicians of the era were unable to rigorously define a quantity with properties of     E   {\displaystyle E} , even though it was common practice to 'neglect' higher power infinitesimals and this seemed to yield correct results.
1762	This problem reappeared later in the 1600s at the center of the development of calculus, where calculations such as Fermat's are important to the calculation of derivatives. Isaac Newton first developed calculus via an infinitesimal quantity called a fluxion. He developed them in reference to the idea of an "infinitely small moment in time..." However, Newton later rejected fluxions in favor of a theory of ratios that is close to the modern     ε  –  δ   {\displaystyle \varepsilon {\text{–}}\delta }  definition of the limit. Moreover, Newton was aware that the limit of the ratio of vanishing quantities was not itself a ratio, as he wrote:
1763	The informal/intuitive aspect to be grasped here is that the definition requires the following internal conversation (which is typically paraphrased by such language as "your enemy/adversary attacks you with an ε, and you defend/protect yourself with a δ"): One is provided with any challenge ε > 0 for a given f, a, and L. One must answer with a δ > 0 such that 0 < |x − a| < δ implies that |f(x) − L| < ε. If one can provide an answer for any challenge, then one has proven that the limit exists.
1764	This is easily shown through graphical understandings of the limit, and as such serves as a strong basis for introduction to proof. According to the formal definition above, a limit statement is correct if and only if confining     x   {\displaystyle x}  to     δ   {\displaystyle \delta }  units of     c   {\displaystyle c}  will inevitably confine     f ( x )   {\displaystyle f(x)}  to     ε   {\displaystyle \varepsilon }  units of     L   {\displaystyle L} . In this specific case, this means that the statement is true if and only if confining     x   {\displaystyle x}  to     δ   {\displaystyle \delta }  units of 5 will inevitably confine
1765	Infinitesimal calculus textbooks based on Robinson's approach provide definitions of continuity, derivative, and integral at standard points in terms of infinitesimals. Once notions such as continuity have been thoroughly explained via the approach using microcontinuity, the epsilon–delta approach is presented as well. Karel Hrbáček argues that the definitions of continuity, derivative, and integration in Robinson-style non-standard analysis must be grounded in the ε–δ method, in order to cover also non-standard values of the input. Błaszczyk et al. argue that microcontinuity is useful in developing a transparent definition of uniform continuity, and characterize the criticism by Hrbáček as a "dubious lament". Hrbáček proposes an alternative non-standard analysis, which (unlike Robinson's) has many "levels" of infinitesimals, so that limits at one level can be defined in terms of infinitesimals at the next level.
1766	In a quantum field theory with fermions, (−1)F is a unitary, Hermitian, involutive operator where F is the fermion number operator. For the example of particles in the Standard Model, it is equal to the sum of the lepton number plus the baryon number, F = B + L.  The action of this operator is to multiply bosonic states by 1 and fermionic states by −1. This is always a global internal symmetry of any quantum field theory with fermions and corresponds to a rotation by 2π. This splits the Hilbert space into two superselection sectors. Bosonic operators commute with (−1)F whereas fermionic operators anticommute with it.
1767	The novel opens with a 13-page section consisting almost entirely of paragraphs that begin "It all began with ...".  These include some simple one-liners (including "bathroom smells, bathroom noises", "hunger, and thirst of course", "the loss of his credit cards") any one of which could start a typically written novel, but here do not.  They also include longer paragraphs that refer all over the map, including some that look like they might have something to do with ***.  For example, one paragraph starts by mentioning that Stu was very much liked by his fellow tenants (Mr. Bresson, Mr. Dostoevsky, Mr. Balzac, Mr. Xman).  But being captioned very much liked was so terrible that Stu needed "a manly atmosphere, heady with *** work, to cure him of this pathos."  Another says that the beginning was when Stu felt he was one in an assembly line of listeners, each bound to repeat the story to the next listener.
1768	The story properly begins with Stu Potts attending a party hosted by Bette Kaye, noted for when "Dov Grey became Dov Grey."  Prominent among the attendees are Dov Grey and his wife Gwenda, employee Jomm Dawrson and his wife Tullshie (also called Miss Tullshie Dawrson née Dreadnought).  Dov and Jomm share their hostility to the popular Hinkle-Winkle, who is "the eternal embodiment of goodish news," and a "freeloading ... world-class houseguest."  In contrast, their wives are sympathetic to Hinkle-Winkle and his associates, "a band of brotherly strugglers all, unhierarchizable sodality of free souls."  We learn later that Gwenda's sister Trendy is "wife and, depending on the time of day, concubine" to Hinkle-Winkle.
1769	The concept of *-autonomous category was introduced by Michael Barr in 1979 in a monograph with that title.  Barr defined the notion for the more general situation of V-categories, categories enriched in a symmetric monoidal or autonomous category V.  The definition above specializes Barr's definition to the case V = Set of ordinary categories, those whose homobjects form sets (of morphisms).  Barr's monograph includes an appendix by his student Po-Hsiang Chu that develops the details of a construction due to Barr showing the existence of nontrivial *-autonomous V-categories for all symmetric monoidal categories V with pullbacks, whose objects became known a decade later as Chu spaces.
1770	Musically, the album marked a sharp turn in style for Blue, whose debut album Another Angry Woman was composed of soft indie pop tracks. Scapi Magazine defined *69 as "a soundscape of vulnerability [that] cuts deep, though you might not realize it at first". They also praised Blue's "avant-pop, experimental ambiance". J.R. Nelson of the Chicago Reader described the style of the album as a "surprise" considering the genre of the singer's past releases, and praised *69 for its unique sound: "a few listens to Blue's radio-ready solo jams, such as Microscope and Falling in Love make it clear that she can translate her razor-sharp hooks into any musical language". Blue went on to win Chicago Reader's Best Pop Artist Award 2019 by virtue of *69's acclaim.
1771	This Vertical Service Code, *82, enables calling line identification regardless of subscriber preference, dialed to unblock withheld numbers (private callers) in the U.S. on a per-call basis. If Caller ID is subscribed to or enabled on the line receiving the call, the unblocked phone number and registered name is displayed – unable to determine that the caller subscribes to outgoing callerID blocking or that *82 has been dialed to temporarily override that subscription. *82 can be dialed from U.S. land-line house phones and business lines, as well as most cell phones and mobile devices. Some mobile devices may alternatively offer or require a menu selection to override Caller ID blocking per call.
1772	*Corpus Callosum is a 2002 experimental Canadian film directed by Michael Snow. The title is a reference to the part of the brain which was once thought to have been home to the human soul, and which scientifically passes messages between the two hemispheres. The Corpus Callosum of the film refers to the mysterious space between illusion and reality. It won the Independent/Experimental Film and Video Award from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association Awards. Corpus Callosum is said to be a "digital self-appraisal of [Snow's] work", showcasing his passion for visual manipulations through editing. Throughout the film, Mr.Snow's voice can be heard as he directs the film, adding to the break in the fourth wall which the film attempts to create.
1773	Office workers go about their day-to-day business, all while their surroundings constantly shift which does not affect them. Workers' clothing changes on their bodies without them noticing, people they are conversing with disappear. At one point, office workers engaging in a meeting suddenly stick together as if drawn to one another by static electricity. Other men in the room begin to contort others' bodies, tying each other into knots with their own limbs. Two men outside shake hands and, when their hands touch, both men melt into one another, emerging after a few seconds having reversed all physical characteristics. People who work in the office also seem to have god-like powers, changing things as simple as the lighting in the room, to as impossible as causing people to walk on the ceiling rather than the floor – all by changing settings on their computers.
1774	A home is shown in which live a mother, a father, and a boy. The three sit on their sofa, completely enthralled by what they are watching on the television as everything around them shifts. The sofa changes colours, as do the walls, the photos, their clothing and more. The living room they sit in is filthy. Scattered about are empty and full cups, pizza and takeout containers which also shift with no apparent notice from the family members. At one point the end credits play on the screen, as though the film were ending. After the credits finish, the film continues playing the same scene, the family sitting in their living room just as they were before.
1775	In 2012, *astTECS launched NTP 2012 Policy compliant IP PBX series with video conferencing facility. In October, 2012, the company expanded its operation in South Africa and Middle East through partners. In September, 2014  *astTECS also appointed as partner in Fiji and started its operation in many parts of India like New Delhi, Pune, Indore, Cochin, Mumbai and Coimbatore. It launched *astTECS IP PBX solution for the hospitality industry in June 2014 and  *astTECS IP PBX solution for educational institutions in June 2016. As of August 2016, it has offices in Ghana and Botswana.
1776	The band was formed in 2003 by singer/songwriter Mehdi Safa and drummer Tom Harriman, after the break-up of their former band Mahumodo. *shels took their name from the 1999 Mahumodo EP, entitled Shels. They released an EP, Wingsfortheirsmiles, in 2004 on Shelsmusic, a record label founded by Safa in 2002. The band released their debut full length studio album, Sea of the Dying Dhow on 18 June 2007, in partnership with Undergroove records. The album attracted positive reviews from critics, culminating in it being named one of the top albums of 2007 by Rock Sound magazine. The band toured the UK in June and July of the same year in support of the album, performing with various groups such as Bossk and The Ghost of a Thousand. The tour included a performance at GuilFest, where the band share a stage with My Vitriol and Zico Chain.
1777	While the previous releases have been written predominantly by Mehdi Safa and Tom Harriman, live performances have featured a number of different artists performing with the band. Vocalist Mehdi Safa said in an interview with Rock Sound, "The whole point of *shels is that it is very free, It is not really a band in the traditional sense, we can have people from other bands come in and play certain shows. It is set up to be a very free vehicle. There is a core of who is involved, but you can compare it to The John Williams Orchestra. It has a core but the line-up changes around that core".
1778	Life like most precious gifts gives us the responsibility of upkeep. We are given the responsibility of arranging our own spaces to best benefit our survival. We have the choice of believing or not believing in things like God, friendship, marriage, love, lust or any number of simple but complicated things. We will make some mistakes both in judgement and in fact. We will help some situations and hurt some situations. We will help some people and hurt some people and be left to live with it either way. We must then make some adjustments, or as the old people back home would call them, + 'JUSTMENTS.
1779	+/-, or Plus/Minus, is an American indietronic band formed in 2001. The band makes use of both electronic and traditional instruments, and has sought to use electronics to recreate traditional indie rock song forms and instrumental structures. The group has released two albums on each of the American indie labels Teenbeat Records and Absolutely Kosher, and their track "All I do" was prominently featured in the soundtrack for the major film Wicker Park. The group has developed a devoted following in Japan and Taiwan, and has toured there frequently. Although many artists append bonus tracks onto the end of Japanese album releases to discourage purchasers from buying cheaper US import versions, the overseas versions of +/- albums are usually quite different from the US versions - track lists can be rearranged, artwork with noticeable changes is used, and tracks from the US version can be replaced as well as augmented by bonus tracks.
1780	Teenbeat Records owner Mark Robinson had been impressed by a solo track that James Baluyut contributed to a 2000 EP Drawn and Quartered issued by Versus, an influential indie rock band in which Baluyut played 2nd guitar. Robinson asked Baluyut to record an album's worth of material for release on Teenbeat, which Baluyut did under the name +/-. Although the first +/- album was essentially a Baluyut solo affair, he had formed a touring and recording band in mid-2001 before the album was released, with Versus drummer Patrick Ramos assuming guitar, keyboard and co-lead vocal duties, Chris Deaner on drums, and Margaret McCartney (formerly of Tuscadero) on bass. McCartney left in 2002 and the other members did not seek a permanent replacement. Since then the band has usually employed Tony Zanella of True Love Always as a tour bassist. Deaner was Kelly Clarkson's tour drummer from early 2007 to spring of 2008, during which time Karl Lundin (Deaner's partner in Loudest Boom Bah Yea) stood in for Deaner while he was on tour with Clarkson.
1781	The group left Teenbeat in mid-2006 to sign to Absolutely Kosher, although Teenbeat did issue a long-delayed split EP with Bloodthirsty Butchers and a retrospective DVD of video clips in 2007. Subsequent to signing with Absolutely Kosher the band's recordings received distribution in central Europe through BB*Island, and the band has since toured Germany and its surrounding nations three times. After the release of Xs on Your Eyes in 2008 the group did not tour the US to any great extent, but concentrated their touring efforts on Asia and continental Europe. In late 2009 the band released the Japan-only EP Thrown into the Fire, and also announced that they had provided the soundtrack for the multiplayer online game Code of Everand, which Chris Deaner had worked on as a lead programmer.
1782	While on the phone with his girlfriend Jill, who has moved away to attend college, David prompts her to explicitly wish that he were there to see her compete in a fencing tournament, only to surprise her with an unplanned visit. After the competition, David approaches Jill's similarly attired opponent from behind and flirts with her, thinking she is his girlfriend. Intrigued, she kisses David, and Jill storms off angrily after walking in on them. Later, David meets with his friend Teddy, a sex-obsessed student who tells him that Jill will attend a house party later. Hoping that she will speak with him in person, David attends the party, too.
1783	A meteor lands near the site of the party, and electrical arcs cause a momentary blackout. The wild revelers do not notice brief, anomalous phenomena that occur during the blackout, such as a mirror image out of sync, but a drug dealer's girlfriend outside the party becomes spooked. As the raucous party proceeds, David searches the house for Jill, and Teddy attempts to charm Melanie. To Teddy's surprise, Melanie invites him to join her upstairs in ten minutes. Meanwhile, David spies on Jill as she flirts with a friend, and Allison, an outsider, unsuccessfully attempts to fit in. David attempts to apologize to Jill, but she becomes more angry with his fumbled apology and says that he makes her feel replaceable. The party moves outside, and the house empties except for David, Teddy, Allison, and Melanie.
1784	When Teddy joins Melanie upstairs, he finds her naked on a bed. They proceed to have sex, and she steps into the shower afterward. During a second blackout, a duplicate of Melanie appears on the bed, surprised to find Teddy in the room. When the original Melanie exits the shower, the two Melanies come face-to-face, and Teddy flees the room in a panic. David confirms that the house has filled with duplicates of the party-goers, who repeat the actions their originals took ten minutes ago. Outside, the drug dealer and his duplicate get into a violent confrontation, and David watches as one of them murders the other. Worried that the duplicates may be hostile, the originals attempt to hide. Eventually, the duplicates disappear.
1785	With each blackout, the duplicates momentarily reappear and reenact increasingly more recent actions. David becomes convinced that he can save his relationship if he crafts a better apology to Jill's duplicate, Allison befriends her duplicate, and Teddy accidentally ruins the rendez-vous between his and Melanie's duplicates. Teddy warns the others that his duplicate will now become belligerent, and he convinces the party-goers, most of whom are still skeptical, to hide from their duplicates in a pool house. When the duplicates reappear, David knocks his own duplicate unconscious and charms Jill's duplicate, and Teddy's duplicate attempts to convince the skeptical crowd of duplicates to attack the originals.
1786	Worried about their safety, several of the originals sneak out and murder their duplicates, which turns the enraged duplicates hostile. The originals retreat back to the pool house, and the duplicates lay siege. The next blackout causes the duplicates to appear inside the pool house. The crowded room erupts in violence, and several people die, including Teddy. David tracks down the original Jill, who had wandered back to the house, and he murders her so that he can be with her duplicate. Allison seduces her duplicate, and they share a kiss. The final blackout causes the duplicates and originals to merge. David and Jill leave together and make their way to the pool house and have a make-out session. The confused party-goers stagger out of the pool house, and they begin to disperse. Two meteors, like the original, are shown passing through the sky and appear to be leaving Earth.
1787	Rotten Tomatoes reports that 75% of 12 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating was 6.6/10. Metacritic rated it 60/100 based on six reviews. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times made it a NYT Critics' Pick and called it "a fleet and frenzied sci-fi tale with more on its mind than alien gate-crashers." Chuck Bowen of Slant Magazine gave the film three out of four stars, commenting that Iliadis did a good job of showing the "existential despair" of narcissism and detachment. Scott Weinberg of Fearnet gave a more mixed review, saying that the film was a "decent, uneven, well-made spin on a very standard horror story". In a mixed review, Geoff Berkshire of Variety called it a "trippy oddity" with "a tantalizing visual puzzle that demands full attention, even as the flavorless characters and largely so-so performances risk audience indifference." Berkshire states the film's "overriding misogyny" may be intentional satire.
1788	In 2003, while working at a PR company, Jonny Kaps started managing an unsigned band called stellastarr* As their manager, Jonny designed a new business model using PR to achieve management goals to grow their career of the artist. Prior to meeting Jonny, Nat worked in advertising and branding at Lipman. The company's clients at the time included fashion brands Burberry, David Yurman, and Ermenegildo Zegna, as well as artists Justin Timberlake and Britney Spears. Nat had been a fan of stellastarr* before they started working with Jonny, and paid close attention to their growth as it was happening. In the summer of 2003, he reached out to Jonny to discuss his strategy and how to scale it. After meeting and realizing their similar visions, Nat and Jonny became partners and started the company which became +1 Records.
1789	In January 2004, +1 launched as the first company in America to merge management and public relations to develop and grow artists careers. It began in Jonny Kaps' apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with three clients, stellastarr*, Two Gallants and The Bravery. Over their first year of business, they grew their roster to ten clients, moved into an office and hired a staff. By 2008, their roster included Ambulance LTD, The Bravery, Basement Jaxx, The BPA (David Byrne), The Cribs, Editors, Jamie T, Kate Nash and The Kooks, Michael Kiwanuka, and TV On The Radio. +1 also created developed marketing campaigns and produced events for Diesel jeans, Playboy, The U.S. Air Guitar Championships and Lebowski Fest.
1790	In 2008, Nat and Jonny made the decision to evolve +1 and launch a full service independent record label. Josh Swade's label at the time, Young American Recordings, worked with +1. Josh Swade's expertise in sales and distribution perfectly complimented +1's A&R and Marketing prowess and he joined Jonny and Nat as a partner in the new label. +1 Records was announced with a full page ad in Spin Magazine proclaiming "+1 Records: Sometime you just gotta say what the f*ck."+1 Records first signings were The Heavy and The Morning Benders, and in 2010 they brought in their first hit, The Heavy's "How You Like Me Now?". Jonny and Nat managed to get the band to perform on Letterman, and after a legendary performance that went viral, the song got featured in a Kia TV commercial that premiered during the 2010 Super Bowl, and became certified gold in the US. +1 managed Atlas Genius in 2012 and followed up by their second gold record with Atlas Genius's "Trojans".
1791	Following their termination from the New Zealand version of The X Factor in 2015, Teddy Sinclair and Willy Moon relocated to the United States. Over the year they began to experiment with music, ultimately resurfacing as Cruel Youth. Their first release was "Mr. Watson", which was uploaded to the band's SoundCloud in February 2016. The song was later released as a single, following "Diamond Days", and a video for the single was released in June 2016. Following the video, Sinclair announced the band would be releasing an EP later that year. On 7 September, the band released the single "Hatefuck" and announced the EP would be released on 16 September. The following day, the official album art was released. In a statement to fans, Sinclair wrote:
1792	Finally, after months of playing and perfecting, our EP +30mg is complete! And now we want you to hear it...With the EP comes our latest single, "Hatefuck", a buzzing ballad I wrote about some of my very lowest moments. Of all the drugs, love is the worst. It seems to come with a set of handcuffs but no key. Some people hit rock bottom, some people crash right through and keep falling down - that was me, and if what came out of it was this song then it was certainly worth it. I hope it means as much to you as it does to us.
1793	The +39 Challenge was one of three Italian teams which competed for the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup in Valencia, Spain.  The team placed 9th in the round robins, and did not qualify for the semi-finals. They broke their mast during Act 13, due to an incident caused by United Internet Team Germany, but managed to replace it before the start of Round Robin 2.  +39 Challenge were awarded redress against the German team who were found to have broken rules regulating opposite tacks and avoiding contact.  +39 Challenge were awarded fifth place in the Act and full costs for the repair of their boat.
1794	+44 (read as Plus Forty-four) was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles, California in 2005. The group consisted of vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, lead guitarist Shane Gallagher of The Nervous Return, and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of Mercy Killers. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the initial 2005 breakup of Blink-182 and before it was later reformed. The band's name refers to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely electronic in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl.
1795	The band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although anticipated by the music press, the band's debut—the album When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006)—did not match commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from the critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album, put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009.
1796	By 2004, Blink-182—consisting of bassist Mark Hoppus, guitarist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker—had emerged as the biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the multiplatinum album Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which reached number one. The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. During this time, he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them in the album Box Car Racer. This latter was recorded with the help of Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, and was intended as a one-time experimental project, but evolved into a full-fledged band, with Barker behind the kit. This side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, the eponymous fifth studio album Blink-182 (2003).
1797	The trio embarked on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. He eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring, in order to spend more time with his family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. DeLonge did not blame his band-mates for being disappointed with his requests, but was himself dismayed that they could not seemingly understand. In addition, DeLonge protested the idea of Barker's reality television series Meet the Barkers, which was being produced for a 2005 premiere. He disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling his personal privacy invaded.
1798	Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. He considered his band-mates priorities very different, coming to the conclusion that the trio had simply grew apart as they aged, had families, and reached fame. The breakdown in communication led to heated exchanges, resulting in his exit from the group. It was announced on February 22, 2005 that Blink-182 would be going on an "indefinite hiatus". DeLonge would not speak to Barker or Hoppus—whom he once considered his greatest friends—for several years. Despite this, Geffen Records president Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that "any press you do, make sure you say everything is cool".
1799	Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence. When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity.
1800	The addition of other members to +44 came gradually. In April 2005, Barker invited his friend Carol Heller to provide vocals on a track. Formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl, Heller traded and shared vocals with Hoppus on most of the band's early demos. Meanwhile, Hoppus invited friend Shane Gallagher to play the guitar on a few tracks the band began working on, and he was soon drafted as a member. Production of the record moved along swiftly once the duo purchased their own North Hollywood studio, which they dubbed Opera Music. The space—which featured two recording rooms, a lounge, and a small outdoor courtyard—was purchased in October 2005 from former Poison guitarist Richie Kotzen. After moving all band gear into the new recording center, the entire direction of the band evolved into a more organic sound. Heller became uneasy with the new direction and, with a desire to start a family, parted ways with the band by the end of the year. Shortly afterward, friend Craig Fairbaugh came in to observe, listen, and to play songs; by the end of the day, Hoppus and Barker asked him to become the fourth member of the group. The band's debut album, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was produced by Hoppus and Barker, with longtime associate and friend Jerry Finn in the role of executive producer.
1801	The release date for When Your Heart Stops Beating was anticipated and publicized by the music press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006, although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus' and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the months prior to the record's release, and countless impostors posted fake songs online. "No, It Isn't" was leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation, as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews prior to the release of the album, instead working on it in relative secrecy, spending time updating his blog, and producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack. "During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders", reported James Montgomery, of MTV News. Even though it pained them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to the media, instead burying themselves in the studio for the recording of the album.
1802	When Your Heart Stops Beating was officially released November 13, 2006. In the United States, the album debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200, with approximately 66,000 copies sold in its first week. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics. The New York Times described it as "zippier and catchier" than Angels & Airwaves' debut studio album We Don't Need to Whisper, but concluded that neither band was as good as Blink-182. As of September 2011, the album sold over 274,000 copies in the US. +44's first show took place at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, on September 7, 2006, with a second appearance following at the London Astoria. The band embarked on a promotional tour in the United Kingdom shortly thereafter. Barker was in constant pain but soldiered through the performances, altering his kit set-up to accommodate. A doctor informed Barker he had broken a bone in his arm during the band's video shoot, and was instructed to immediately rest and not take part in the band's upcoming live dates, including early 2007 jaunts to Australia and Europe. Barker nevertheless took part, but after an excruciating Amsterdam gig, the band drafted Gil Sharone, then of The Dillinger Escape Plan, to fill-in for him.
1803	The tour rolled on to Australia and Japan, where the band busied itself with press junkets and appearances. Crowds were, according to journalist Joe Shooman, mainly Blink-182 fans. Hoppus relished the opportunity to return to smaller, more intimate club dates, rather than the massive arenas of latter-day Blink. The band spent April to June 2007 on the Honda Civic Tour of the US and Canada alongside Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is… and Paul Wall. The band began slipping old Blink songs—"What's My Age Again?" and "The Rock Show"—into set lists, despite the band's rather adamant stance against doing so months before, apparently due to Hoppus and Barker fond feelings with Blink-182.
1804	Further August 2007 dates were postponed. Hoppus stated the band had decided to re-enter the studio in preparation of a second studio album. Hoppus and Barker spent the remainder of the year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see its release via Interscope Records. According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album. Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo too, although the duo continued to work together.
1805	"Maybe, I would never say never but I haven't talked with Craig (Fairbaugh) or Shane (Gallagher) in years and I think that they have moved on in their lives and we're in a different place, but that album holds such a special place in my life and in my memory and the lyrics and the making of that album was a huge moment of me working through the death of Blink-182 at the time and that holds a really special place in my heart so I would love to play it again at some point."
1806	Noam Sheizaf said: "The attack on +972 is being carried out in the standard way NGO Monitor, Im Tirzu and similar organizations work these days: Not by debating the content of our reports and commentary pieces, but by trying to delegitimize and silence us." In February 2012, Sheizaf said "Jewish American liberals are not on our side. [Most Americans] will only support my liberalism to a certain degree. When I fight for the right of an Arab woman to become a doctor, you will stand by and donate to the New Israel Fund. But if I say 'Jerusalem is an apartheid city,' which it is—Jerusalem is the worst place in the world in terms of citizenship laws—American liberals get goosebumps."
1807	The plot revolves around four +Anima children: Cooro, Husky, Senri, and Nana. Brought together by their +Anima powers, they search for others like themselves and a place to belong. Along the way, they encounter villains and friends alike, as well as other +Anima. Like many episodic adventure manga, there is not a big overarching story, rather the group travels from town to town, and at each stop over, they get wrapped up in local events. Examples of these adventures include Cooro helping a man fix and use a hang glider (man-lifting kite) to acquire medicine for his village, the group learning the secret of a monstrous +Anima that has been terrorizing another village, and Husky rescuing a man who has fallen in love with the legend of a mermaid. As the series progresses, more is learned about the characters' backstory, and about the setting of +Anima.
1808	In the +Anima fantasy world, some humans have an unusual gift that grants them the ability to morph one or more of their body parts, such as their limbs, into an animal's body part. Some are capable of even more radical changes, such as growing wings or full-body transformation. The transformation processes are very fast, and occur at the user's will. When inactive, the morphed areas revert to normal, leaving the person's clothing and body completely untouched. The only visual mark of this ability appears on the body of the person, in the form of a black, tattoo-like marking that determines their +Anima. Occasionally, the user bears some behavioral characteristics of their animal.
1809	The announcement of the block came on March 8, 2018, and the debut came in October 2018 with its first anime Ingress: The Animation. According to +Ultra and Noitamina producer Mori Akitoshi from Fuji TV, the programming block is kind of a brother to the Noitamina block due to being a unique vision of an anime block much like it. In the announcement, it was said that the block was made due to the diversification of viewing media with anime being shared around the world via streaming services, which is why the block is based on the concept of spreading anime culture overseas with high-quality animation for the world.
1810	Media interest surrounding + was heightened by its two preceding singles—"The A Team" and "You Need Me, I Don't Need You"—which peaked at numbers three and four on the UK Singles Chart, respectively. "Lego House" was released on 11 November 2011 as the album's third single and matched the chart success of its predecessors, peaking at number five in the UK. Three additional singles—"Drunk", "Small Bump", and "Give Me Love"—were released throughout the year, all charting within the top 25 of the UK Singles Chart. Worldwide, the album has sold more than 4 million copies.
1811	In early 2010, Sheeran was having what he described as a "rough time" in the UK, and he spontaneously left for Los Angeles to spend a month "to see what could happen". After performing a gig in the city, he was approached by Foxx's contact, who produced open-mic nights endorsed by Foxx. She invited him to perform, which he agreed to, and after the performance he was contacted by Foxx's manager, who then asked him to perform on Foxx's radio show. After performing on the radio show, Foxx gave Sheeran his number offering studio time free of charge. Sheeran took the opportunity to record several tracks in the studio and attended several parties with Foxx, describing the time as "surreal". In addition, Sheeran's appearances on YouTube also garnered success when he uploaded a performance of track "You Need Me, I Don't Need You", which garnered over half a million views, making him "one of the most talked about UK acts".
1812	Following this, Sheeran signed to Atlantic Records and was signed to Elton John's management team called Rocket, which Sheeran discussed, saying: "Elton walked in and said, 'Where's Ed Sheeran?' I was like, 'F-ing hell! He knows my name!' It's surreal, growing up listening to his music and now he is one of the people who sings my praises and helps my career and rings me up and actually has an interest in me". Sheeran started performing with the acoustic guitar aged 11 and his love for the instrument was what "got [him] into music and singing". His musical inspirations from an early age surfaced from The Beatles and Bob Dylan, but he noted Damien Rice as a larger influence on his music whom he met after an intimate performance in Dublin. Throughout the production of +, Sheeran knew "how [he] wanted every single song to sound", and because of this they only took around one day each to record, with the final product featuring "the same sound", which he described as an achievement.
1813	+ is influenced by rapper Eminem, hip-hop inspired duo Nizlopi and recording artist Damien Rice. Sheeran performs throughout the record with a small acoustic guitar, with "no band" and "no beats". The Daily Telegraph found that the lyricism is based around subjects he cares about in his own life, performing with a "soft toned, flexible voice" with a hip-hop theme. The record features "chipper" beats with staccato guitar riffs throughout. It differs between genres, with tracks such as "Grade 8" showing R&B influences, garnering comparisons to Bruno Mars, while the album also features folk-hop inspired tracks such as "Drunk", a "self-pitying, doomed attempt to resurrect a lost relationship". Lyricism also derives from Sheeran's own "self-doubt" heard in tracks such as "Wake Me Up" and "Kiss Me", which has been compared to musician Van Morrison. The record also visits a "darker side" on tracks such as "The City", which depicts homeless street-life and features Sheeran beat-boxing. The album concludes with the track "Give Me Love" and the Scottish folk song "The Parting Glass" as a bonus track.
1814	+ received mixed to favourable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 67, based on 9 reviews, which indicates "generally favorable reviews". Andy Gill of The Independent gave the album four stars out of five, finding that Sheeran was right to follow his own "instincts" and not conform to mainstream pop music, saying: "if he had followed the advice to tone down the crackhead portrait of 'The A Team', Sheeran might have wound up with a respectable, if predictable, career as a mainstream folkie singer-songwriter rocking the outer reaches of Radio Two" but found his "nimble hip-hop delivery rides a slick R&B groove" and his "blue-collar sensibilities cut through" after not attending schools such as the Brits school. Alex Petridis of The Guardian gave the album three out of five stars, writing that, "at its worst, + is a pretty winsome business"; Petridis found the lyricism of tracks such as "Wake Me Up" weak, but stated that, "apart from his teen appeal, Sheeran's strength is his melodic ability, a way with a really strong, radio-friendly tune, as on 'The City' or 'Grade 8'". However, Petridis concluded his review by stating: "You can't help wishing he'd put said ability to slightly more edgy use, but then again, he still might: at least there's evidence that Ed Sheeran might still be around when the screaming girls grow up and calm down." Jon O'Brien of AllMusic found that Sheeran failed to "capitalize on his unique selling point", stating: "Indeed, the unexpected hugely popular response to lead single 'The A Team', an achingly tender tale of a heroin-addicted prostitute (think a socially aware James Blunt) seems to have thrown him off course, as rather than pursue the more urban direction that set him apart from his contemporaries, the majority of Plus' 12 tracks feel like self-conscious attempts to replicate its sound".
1815	Natalie Shaw of BBC Music gave the album a mixed response, calling + at times "precocious" and "self-referencing", with the track "You Need Me, I Don't Need You" being listed as an example of this. However, in contrast, she found "Drunk" to be sweet, considered "Grade 8" a standout track, and positively commented on the chorus of track "The City". In conclusion, Shaw stated: "+ will give Sheeran's rabid fanbase a lot to love, but it'll also make him an easy target for critics hungry for new directions in pop, as it fails to really gel the man's loves of folk and rap. If he ditches his bottom-of-a-Tube-escalator ballads (see 'Kiss Me') and stops trying to show off, Sheeran could well become a thrilling proposition over an entire long-player, rather than just in all-too-brief moments of magic." John Lewis of newspaper Metro gave the album a mixed review. He stating that Sheeran "is at his best when he combines both worlds. Accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, his lovelorn ballads will suddenly lurch into verbose, rhythmically complex rhymes that display all the verbal dexterity of a grime MC". However, Lewis also found that Sheeran failed to maintain the success throughout, performing "gloopy" and "anonymous" ballads. Emily Mackay of NME gave the album four out of ten marks, questioning his authenticity as a musician. She wrote: "He's got the touches of 'urban' styling with flimsy hip-hop rhythms and Plan B-lite veering between half-arsed rapping and boyband emoting. He's got the 'issues' songs (the Dido-ish, maudlin 'Drunk', the omnipresent saccharine horror of the drugs/homelessness/prostitution triple-whammy of 'The A-Team')". She concluded her review by noting that "There's little here that moves on from the kind of trip-hop balladeers that abounded in the late '90s".
1816	In the United Kingdom, midweek sales reports showed that + was set to top the UK Albums Chart, although Digital Spy reported that it still faced competition from Laura Marling's album A Creature I Don't Know. For the week of 18 September 2011, + debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 102,000 copies. After the album topped the chart, Sheeran wrote on his Twitter account "No. 1 album and 2 songs in the top 20! mental! Thank you all so much!", and then added "Here's my THANK YOU for getting my album to #1! Hope you enjoy it", including a link to download a free EP. The EP featured three tracks: "Fire Alarms", "She" and a remix of single "You Need Me, I Don't Need You". By the end of 2011, the album had been certified Triple Platinum, indicating sales of over 900,000 copies. As of June 2015, the album has sold 1,958,000 copies in the UK, making it the sixth-best-selling album of the 2010s and the 44th-best-selling album of the 21st century. It is also one of the longest-charting albums in UK chart history, with over 200 weeks on the UK Albums Chart.
1817	In Ireland, the album was placed in the top 10 for 8 consecutive years, from 2011 to 2018.In Australia, the album debuted at number 41 on the ARIA Albums Chart for the week commencing 31 October 2011, peaking at number one on 13 August 2012. The album has been certified Triple Platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). By January 2013, the album had spent 65 consecutive weeks on the ARIA Albums Chart and was still in the Top 5. With 222 weeks, it is the all-time longest charting album in Australia. It reached the top 10 in 6 non-consecutive years, in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2018, including a placement at No. 6 in its 222nd charting week in March 2018. In New Zealand, the album debuted at number 34 and ultimately topped the chart 54 weeks later.  + debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 in the United States, selling 42,000 units in its first week. As of March 2017, + has sold 1.21 million copies in the United States.
1818	Ed Sheeran announced in May 2011 a 21 date UK & Ireland tour where he played songs from the newly realised album. Sheeran then went on to add further dates for the start of 2012 and it was confirmed he would be playing his largest gig yet at Brixton Academy. Ed Sheeran would be touring the US for the first time in early 2012 by supporting Snow Patrol on their Fallen Empires Tour. It was announced that Sheeran would be touring Australia and New Zealand for the first time in the July and August 2012. Sheeran then announced in January that he would be doing his first headline tour of the US and his largest headline shows to date in the UK. Before supporting Taylor Swift on her The Red Tour, Sheeran embarked on an 18 date tour across the US
1819	"+" (alternatively titled "+ (Más)" in all caps; Spanish for "More") is a song by Spanish singer Aitana and Colombian duo Cali y El Dandee. The song was released on December 18, 2019 through Universal Music as the lead single of Aitana's upcoming second studio album 11 Razones (2020). It was written by Aitana, Cali y El Dandee and Andrés Torres. The song debuted at number 21 on the Spanish single chart with only two days of tracking, making it the only song in Spanish chart history to reach this position with within two days. The song peaked at number two in its second week.
1820	During the summer 2019, Aitana began hinting at a new single that would feature a well-known artist. Originally scheduled to be released in November, the singer announced the release of "+" through her social media on 4 December 2019. The featured artist remained unknown for months. Aitana and the duo first met in April 2018 in Los Angeles when they helped her record her debut studio album. In 2019, the duo eventually called her again in order to make a song together. The first teaser of the song was released on 16 December.
1821	The EP was the 6th best-selling album of August 2018, with 41,583 physical copies sold. On September, the EP sold 5,903 additional copies for a total of 47,486 copies sold. On October 15, it was reported that the album was the best-selling album by a girl group that debuted in 2018, after surpassing 50,000 copies sold. The album sold 52,823 physical copies in 2018, being the second best-selling album by a girl group that debuted in 2018 after Iz*One's Color*Iz, 15th best-selling album by a girl group and 80th best-selling album overall in 2018.
1822	+ - (pronounced "plus minus") is the sixth studio album by Danish alternative rock band Mew. It was released on 24 April 2015. The album was produced by Michael Beinhorn and was promoted by the singles "Satellites" and "Water Slides". It was Mew's first studio album in five-and-a-half years, following their 2009 record No More Stories.... Bassist Johan Wohlert made his return on this album after being absent from the band's previous album following his departure in 2006. + - was also the final album to feature guitarist Bo Madsen, who left the band on 1 July 2015, as well as the final album to featured original formation.
1823	Most of the tree's branches resemble the laburnum in their foliage, which has three leaflets (3-palmate) and 3–6 cm long, yet also with dense clusters of broom-like shoots, also with three leaflets, but only 1 cm long and a darker green. It flowers in late spring or early summer; some branches have long (20–30 cm) racemes of yellow laburnum flowers, while others produce dense clusters of purple broom flowers. Remarkably, most branches will also produce coppery-pink flowers on short (8–15 cm) racemes, which are midway between the two "parents"; the leaves on these shoots are also intermediate. In older specimens, the proportion of broom and mixed tissues tends to decline, and the laburnum to predominate. The tree grows to a height of 7 m (rarely 8 m) and is hardy to USDA plant hardiness zone 5 in northern Europe. It requires moderately fertile, moist but well-drained soil and should be grown in a sunny position to flower well.
1824	-196˚C Strong Zero (commonly referred to as Strong Zero) is a brand of chūhai owned by Suntory. It is currently sold in Japan and Taiwan. As with other types of chūhai, it is available in a variety of different flavors, and is often sold at convenience stores and vending machines. The "strong" portion of the name comes from the fact that the drinks can be as high as 9% ABV. The "zero" refers to what the manufacturer calls "sugar-free". According to nutrition labeling standards, it can be labeled as sugar-free as long as the product does not exceed 0.5g of sugar per 100mL.
1825	There are many theories as to how the usage came into being, and why it is found in North America but not in other Anglophone nations. One theory is that the journalistic employment of -30- originated from the number's use during the American Civil War era in the 92 Code of telegraphic shorthand, where it signified the end of a transmission and that it found further favor when it was included in the Phillips Code of abbreviations and short markings for common use that was developed by the Associated Press wire service. Telegraph operators familiar with numeric wire signals such as the 92 Code used these railroad codes to provide logistics instructions and train orders, and they adapted them to notate an article's priority or confirm its transmission and receipt. This meta-data would occasionally appear in print when typesetters included the codes in newspapers, especially the code for "No more – the end", which was presented as "- 30 -" on a typewriter.
1826	"-30-" is the series finale of the HBO original series The Wire. With a running time of 93 minutes, this tenth and final episode of the fifth season is the longest episode of the series. The episode was written by series creator/executive producer David Simon (teleplay/story) and co-executive producer Ed Burns (story). It was directed by Clark Johnson, who also directed the pilot episode and stars on the show. It aired on March 9, 2008. The episode's writers were nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series.
1827	McNulty identifies a mentally ill homeless man as the killer and the Baltimore Police Department charge him with two of the six "murders". Carcetti holds a press conference taking credit for both the "serial killer's" capture and the Stanfield arrests, then promotes Daniels to Police Commissioner. However, after Steintorf once again requests that Daniels "juke the stats" to boost Carcetti's position on crime reduction, he refuses, and is forced to resign after Campbell threatens to expose his past wrongdoings. Cheese is killed by Slim Charles for his role in Proposition Joe's murder. 
1828	McNulty locates Larry and drives him back to Baltimore, stopping to look over the city on the way. In a closing montage, Carcetti is elected governor while Campbell becomes mayor; Valchek replaces Daniels as Commissioner; Pearlman, now a judge, recuses herself from a case Daniels is arguing; Marlo becomes a "legitimate businessman" and realizes he has lost his street cred; Spider runs his own crew on Bodie Broadus's former corner; Michael and a partner stick up Vinson, deliberately emulating Omar; the remaining Co-Op members meet with Vondas and The Greek; Dukie uses the money he borrowed from Prez to feed his new drug addiction; Templeton wins a Pulitzer Prize while Gus and Alma are demoted; Kenard is arrested.
1829	The movie is set between approximately 3 p.m. and just after midnight on a day in November 1959.  Managing Editor Sam Gatlin and his staff put together the early edition of the Examiner, a morning newspaper in Los Angeles. During a particularly active news night, Gatlin and his second wife (of three years), Peggy, disagree about adopting a seven-year-old boy named Billy. (Peggy can't have children and wants to adopt.  Gatlin's young son from his first marriage had been killed several years before, presumably in some sort of accident.  Gatlin tells Peggy he can't ever let himself love another child because losing that child, too, would destroy him.)  Longtime reporter Lady Wilson's grandson pilots a military bomber from Honolulu to New York, intending to set a speed record. A child is lost and feared drowned in the L.A. sewers during this night's torrential rainstorm; Gatlin composes a warning headline with a two-page-wide picture of a storm drain: "DANGER, KIDS! STAY OUT OF THESE! One little girl didn't!". Copy boy Earl Collins considers quitting after failing to place a $1 bet for city editor Jim Bathgate concerning how many babies a famous Italian actress would give birth to that day. (It was twins, at 50-1 odds.)  Bathgate demands and gets an IOU from the woefully underpaid Collins to cover the $50 Bathgate would have won, but Bathgate tears it up, smiling to himself, on his way out of the newsroom at the end of the film.
1830	Juridical Opinion n° 2 in the Bacteriological Code discusses the declension of the word, given that authors differently assumed the genitive case of bacter to be bactris (3rd declension words of Latin origin ending in =ter), bacteri (2nd declension) or bacteris (3rd declension, used for words of Greek origin, such as astris).  The Opinion opts for the latter: consequently, higher taxa are formed with the stem =bacter- and not =bactr-. In Juridical Opinion n° 3 it was established to be masculine.For example, Campylobacter is a genus of Campylobacterales.These rules were established so that the specific epithets were paired with the correct gender as imposed by the Bacteriological Code and the correct higher taxon names were formed.An interesting effect of this is that the genus Fibrobacter gives its name both to the phylum Fibrobacteres, which obeys Latin grammar, and to the class Fibrobacteria, which follows the recommendation of using the suffix -ia
1831	The bylaws of some clubs and other organizations may define an official position of president-elect similar to a vice president position.  The members of the organization elect the president-elect, rather than directly electing the organization's president.  The president-elect may be given limited duties, similar to a vice president.  At the end of the term, the president-elect is promoted to the position of president, and a new president-elect is elected.  The advantage of this schema is a clear continuity of succession, as well as the opportunity to familiarize the president-elect with the operations of the organization before becoming president. A possible drawback is that once a president-elect has been elected, another person cannot be elected president unless the president-elect resigns or is removed from office.
1832	The position of president-elect is different from someone who was elected president and is called "president-elect" between the time of election and the start of the term. For example, if an election for president was held in January, but the term of office does not begin until March, the person who was elected president may be called "president-elect" but does not hold any power until the term begins in March. On the other hand, someone in the position of president-elect has all the powers of that position that the bylaws provide.
1833	The suffix -ene is used in organic chemistry to form names of organic compounds where the -C=C- group has been attributed the highest priority according to the rules of organic nomenclature. Sometimes a number between hyphens is inserted before it to say that the double bond is between that atom and the atom with the next number up. This suffix is taken from the end of the word ethylene, which is the simplest alkene. The final "-e" disappears if it is followed by a suffix that starts with a vowel, e.g. "-enal" which is a compound that contains both a -C=C- bond and an aldehyde functional group. If the other suffix starts with a consonant or "y", the final "-e" remains, e.g. "-enediyne" (which has the "-ene" suffix and also the "-yne" suffix, for a compound with a double bond and two triple bonds.)
1834	The -gry puzzle is a popular word puzzle that asks for the third English word that ends with the letters -gry other than angry and hungry. Specific wording varies substantially, but the puzzle has no clear answer, as there are no other common English words that end in -gry.  Interpretations of the puzzle suggest it is either an answerless hoax; a trick question; a sincere question asking for an obscure word; or a corruption of a more straightforward puzzle, which may have asked for words containing gry (such as gryphon). Of these, countless trick question variants and obscure English words (or nonce words) have been proposed. The lack of a conclusive answer has ensured the enduring popularity of the puzzle, and it has become one of the most frequently asked word puzzles.
1835	In Anita Richterman's column on May 9, 1975, several correspondents reported that they had heard the puzzle on the Bob Grant radio talk show on WMCA in New York City. This suggests either that the earlier claims of a (TV) quiz show confused a talk show with a quiz show, or that there was another unspecified quiz show that was then repeated by Grant. The majority of readers gave the answer "gry," an obsolete unit of measure invented by John Locke. It is unclear whether this was the answer given on the Grant show, or what the precise wording had been.
1836	There are numerous similar puzzles, giving letter sequences that rarely occur in words. The most-notable of these is the -dous puzzle of finding words ending in -dous, which was popular in the 1880s. This took various forms, sometimes simply listing all words or all common words, sometimes being posed as a riddle, giving the three common words, tremendous, stupendous, and hazardous, and requesting the rarer fourth, which is jeopardous. This form originated in 1883, with an A.A. of Glasgow writing to George Augustus Henry Sala in his "Echoes of the Week" column in the Illustrated London News.This question has had enduring popularity, even inspiring a contest, though the words have proven less stable: today jeopardous is considered too rare, and the formerly unpopular horrendous has taken its place; this change occurred as early as 1909. At times other words such as hybridous have been accepted. Today hazardous is typically the omitted word, and differs from the others in being a visible compound hazard + -ous. This puzzle has continued in popularity through the end of the 20th century, with recent versions giving it as an alternative to the gry puzzle.There is a Russian puzzle which goes: "There are three words in the Russian language which end in -zo. Two of them are zhelezo "iron" and puzo "belly". What is the third word?" There is quite a handful of other nouns that end in -zo, in the Russian language, but most of them are fairly obscure terms like авизо, abbreviations or proper names like Кензо. Another similar one is words ending in -cion, of which the common words are coercion, scion, and suspicion.
1837	The standard way to solve such puzzles is to use a reverse dictionary, or to perform an exhaustive search through a dictionary, either manually, which is tedious and error-prone, or using computer tools such as grep, which requires an electronic word list. At the origin of the gry puzzle, the standard reverse dictionary in modern English was the "Air Force Reverse Dictionary" (formally the Normal and Reverse Word List, compiled under the direction of A. F. Brown), which did not have additional answers for gry. The most plausible answer at the time was meagry, found in the Oxford English Dictionary. A more elaborate strategy is to list words that have endings similar to gry, such as -gary, and then search a larger dictionary for obsolete variants ending in -gry, for example begry for beggary.
1838	In common and literary adjectives (e.g. asinine, canine, feline, ursine), the suffix is usually pronounced  or in some words alternatively . For demonyms (e.g. Levantine, Byzantine, Argentine) it is usually  or . But in chemistry, it is usually pronounced  or  depending on the word it appears in and the accent of the speaker. In a few words (for example, quinine, iodine and strychnine), the  sound is normal in some accents. Gasoline ends with ; glycerine more often with  than with . In caffeine, the suffix has merged with the e in the root, for stressed ; in gasoline and margarine as well the suffix is stressed by some people.
1839	The -ing of Modern English in its participial (adjectival) use comes from Middle English -inge, -ynge, supplanting the earlier -inde, -ende, -and, from the Old English present participle ending -ende. This is from Proto-Germanic *-andz, from the Proto-Indo-European *-nt-. This use of English -ing is cognate with Dutch and German -end, Swedish -ande, -ende, Latin -ans, -ant-, Ancient Greek -ον (-on), and Sanskrit -ant. -inde, -ende, -and later assimilated with the noun and gerund suffix -ing. Its remnants, however, are still retained in a few verb-derived words such as friend, fiend, and bond (in the sense of "peasant, vassal").
1840	The standard pronunciation of the ending -ing in modern English is "as spelt", namely /ɪŋ/, with a velar nasal consonant (the typical ng sound also found in words like thing and bang); some dialects, e.g. in Northern England, have /ɪŋg/ instead. However, many dialects use, at least some of the time and in some cases exclusively, an ordinary n sound instead (an alveolar nasal consonant), with the ending pronounced as /ɪn/ or /ən/. Many other speakers, particularly those from anywhere in the United States, not just California, other Western states, and even Midwestern areas, including the Upper Midwest, enunciate -ing as /in/, akin to how "in" is typically pronounced by speakers with accents from Australia or Spanish-speaking countries, whether as a standalone word or a syllable. Yet this pronunciation is incorrect and was described as a "corruption of the language" to listeners. This may be denoted in eye dialect writing with the use of an apostrophe to represent the apparent "missing g"; for example runnin' in place of running. For more detail see g-dropping.
1841	Confusion is most likely to arise when the -ing word follows a verb, in which case it may be a predicate adjective and hence a participle, or a direct object (or predicate nominative) and hence a gerund. There are certain transformations that can help distinguish these two cases. In the table that follows, the transformations produce grammatical sentences with similar meanings when applied to sentences with gerunds (since the transformations are based on the assumption that the phrase with the -ing word is a noun phrase). When applied to sentences with participles, they produce ungrammatical sentences or sentences with completely different meanings. (These cases are marked with asterisks.)
1842	In some situations, the distinction between gerund/participle uses and deverbal uses may be lost, particularly when the -ing word appears on its own. For example, in "I like swimming", it is not clear whether swimming is intended as a gerund (as it would be in "I like swimming fast"), or as a pure noun (as in "I like competitive swimming"). Note that there may be a distinction in meaning between the two interpretations: as a gerund, it means that the speaker likes to swim, while as a pure noun it does not specify in what way the speaker enjoys the activity (as a competitor, spectator, etc.)
1843	The first recorded usage of the suffix ism as a separate word in its own right was in 1680. By the nineteenth century it was being used by Thomas Carlyle to signify a pre-packaged ideology. It was later used in this sense by such writers as Julian Huxley and George Bernard Shaw. In the United States of the mid-nineteenth century, the phrase "the isms" was used as a collective derogatory term to lump together the radical social reform movements of the day (such as slavery abolitionism, feminism, alcohol prohibitionism, Fourierism, pacifism, Technoism, early socialism, etc.) and various spiritual or religious movements considered non-mainstream by the standards of the time (such as Transcendentalism, spiritualism or "spirit rapping", Mormonism, the Oneida movement often accused of "free love", etc.).  Southerners often prided themselves on the American South being free from all of these pernicious "Isms" (except for alcohol temperance campaigning, which was compatible with a traditional Protestant focus on individual morality).  So on September 5 and 9, 1856, the Examiner newspaper of Richmond, Virginia ran editorials on "Our Enemies, the Isms and their Purposes", while in 1858 "Parson" Brownlow called for a "Missionary Society of the South, for the Conversion of the Freedom Shriekers, Spiritualists, Free-lovers, Fourierites, and Infidel Reformers of the North" (see The Freedom-of-thought Struggle in the Old South by Clement Eaton).  In the present day, it appears in the title of a standard survey of political thought, Today's Isms by William Ebenstein, first published in the 1950s, and now in its 11th edition.
1844	-ismist Recordings  was a Lincoln, Nebraska-based independent record label founded in 1992 by Dan Schlissel. Over the 1990s, -ismist released nearly 80 albums and singles by bands including Killdozer, Season to Risk, and House of Large Sizes. It is most widely known for comedy albums by Lewis Black and Doug Stanhope, as well as Iowa metal band Slipknot's 1997 debut/demo, Mate.Feed.Kill.Repeat. By the early 2000s, after Slipknot had moved on to major label Roadrunner Records and Schlissel had found greater success with comedians like Black and Stanhope than with indie rock, he changed his focus to comedy albums on a new, Minneapolis-based label, Stand Up! Records, which eventually replaced -ismist entirely.
1845	In 1988, Schlissel was a student at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, where he majored in physics, worked at an off-campus record store called Feedback, and booked concerts for the university as chairman of the concert and dance committee. In 1992, inspired by the success of indie music labels such as Sub Pop, he founded the label which would eventually become -ismist Recordings, at first basing the business out of his dorm room at the university. The label's original name, -ism, was short for "In Spite of Myself" and was also meant to embrace a wide diversity of art and philosophy. In 1996, Schlissel changed the name to -ismist, short for “In Spite of Myself, In Spite of Them,” after New York punk band Ism objected that the original name was too similar to its own.
1846	This was followed by other local Lincoln groups such as Floating Opera, Honeyboy Turner, Fullblown, and Polecat. Instead of confining itself to a single genre, -ismist's catalog ranged across musical styles, including punk rock, ska, singer-songwriter, rap, metal, and alternative rock. In 1996, it released Madison, Wisconsin noise-rock band Killdozer's final 7-inch single, Go Big Red, featuring the songs "Sonnet '96" and a Hank Williams cover, "I Saw The Light." Other notable -ismist releases included the vinyl edition of Cedar Falls, Iowa, alt-rock band House of Large Sizes' album Glass Cockpit, and the 1999 split 7-inch single '"Ace of Space"/"Tall and Thin Hit Men", split between Kansas City bands Season to Risk and Molly McGuire. Schlissel, via -ismist, also distributed other Nebraska and Midwestern indie labels, including Speed Nebraska Records, Corn Pie Records, and Two Olive Martini Records, and organized two music festivals in 1996 and 1997.
1847	Schlissel recorded Black's The White Album in Madison, Wisconsin, in 1999, with John Machnik, who would be his production partner for many years. Released on -ismist, the album was an immediate success, eventually selling around 60,000 copies, more than the entire previous -ismist catalog combined. Schlissel decided to reinvent -ismist entirely, moving from indie-rock and punk to comedy. The label would go on to release several other comedy albums, including two by Doug Stanhope,  Sicko and Something to Take the Edge Off, and Jimmy Shubert's Animal Instincts, while Schlissel launched a new label, Stand Up! Records, in 2000. By 2002, -ismist had effectively closed down and been replaced by Stand Up! Records. Schlissel has occasionally revived the -ismist name, such as for the 2006 tribute compilation We Will Bury You: A Tribute to Killdozer.
1848	As a standalone term, Jān is the rough equivalent of Darling, and is used almost exclusively for close relatives (such as spouses, lovers and children). In this context, sometimes colloquial forms such as Jānoo and Jānaa, or combination words such as Jāneman (my darling) and Jānejaan/Jānejaana (roughly, "love of my life"), are also used. When used with a name or a relation-term, it means "dear". So, bhāi-sāhab and bhāi-ji carry the meaning of respected brother, whereas bhāi-jān or bhaiyya-jānī mean dear brother. The term meri jān, roughly meaning my dear, can be used with friends of the same gender, or in intimate relationships with the opposite gender. In subcontinental etiquette, while bhaijan can be used by males to denote a brotherly relation with any other male of a roughly similar age including total strangers (the female equivalent between women is apajan or didijan), meri jān is used only with friends with whom informality has been established. Ji, on the other hand, is appropriate in all these situations and across genders because it carries no connotations of intimacy.
1849	Because English usage is widespread in the Indian subcontinent, the fact that the honorific Ji is pronounced identically to the letter G is used extensively in puns. This is sometimes deliberately exploited in consumer marketing, such as with the popular "Parle-G Biscuits" (where the "G" ostensibly stands for Glucose), which sounds like Parle Ji Biscuits (or, the respected Parle biscuits). A pun popular with children in North India and Pakistan consists entirely of Latin letters BBG T PO G, which is pronounced very similarly to Bibi-ji, Tea pi-o ji, "respected ma'am, please have some tea". Some people also add an "A" or "O" to this pun as a prefix to give effect as if a person is calling the Bibi-ji, in a typical Indian friendly way used in regional slangs. Thus we may also write it as O BBG T PO G. One may even add the answer of Bibi-ji as PKIG, "I just had the tea".
1850	The Old English nouns in -lác include brýdlác "nuptials" (from the now obsolete bridelock), beadolác, feohtlác and heaðolác "warfare", hǽmedlác and wiflác "sexual intercourse", réaflác "robbery",  wítelác "punishment", wróhtlác "calumny" besides the wedlác "pledge-giving", also "nuptials" ancestral to wedlock. A few compounds appear only in Middle English, thus dweomerlak "occult practice, magic", ferlac "terror",  shendlac "disgrace", treulac "faithfulness", wohlac "wooing", all of them extinct by the onset of Early Modern English. The earliest words taking the -lác suffix were probably related to warfare, comparable to the -pleȝa (-play) suffix found in "swordplay".
1851	The etymology of the suffix is the same as that of the noun lác 'play, sport,' but also 'sacrifice, offering,' corresponding to obsolete Modern English lake (dialectal laik) 'sport, fun, glee, game,' cognate to Gothic laiks 'dance,' Old Norse leikr 'game, sport' (origin of English lark 'play, joke, folly') and Old High German leih 'play, song, melody.' Ultimately, the word descends from Proto-Germanic *laikaz. Old English lícian ('to please,' Modern English like) is from the same root. In modern English, the noun has been reintroduced through the cognate Swedish lek as a specialist term referring to mating behavior.
1852	Only found in Old English is the meaning of '(religious) offering, sacrifice, human sacrifice,' in  Beowulf 1583f. of the Danes killed by Grendel, in Lambeth Homilies (ca. 1175) of the sacrifice of Christ. In the Anglo-Saxon Gospel (ca. 1000) in Matthew 8:4 for δωρον, denoting an offering according to Mosaic law. In the 13th century it appears to lose its religious connotations and denotes gifts more generally,  of the offerings of the Three Magi (Ancrene Riwle 152, ca. 1225), and in Genesis and Exodus (ca. 1225, 1798) of the gifts sent by Jacob to Esau. From the 14th century, under the influence of to lake 'to move quickly, to leap, to fight,' the noun comes to mean 'fun, sport' exclusively. In this meaning, it survives into the 19th century in North English dialect in the compound lake-lass 'female playmate.'
1853	Hermann (1928) identifies as such *ansulaikaz the hymns sung by the Germans to their god of war mentioned by Tacitus and the victory songs of the Batavi mercenaries serving under Gaius Julius Civilis after the victory over Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Batavian rebellion of 69 AD, and also the 'abominable song' to Wodan sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579. The sacrificial animal was a goat, around whose head the Lombards danced in a circle while singing their victory hymn. As their Christian prisoners refused to 'adore the goat,' they were all killed (Hermann presumes) as an offering to Wodan.
1854	In English names for fields of study, the suffix -logy is most frequently found preceded by the euphonic connective vowel o so that the word ends in -ology.  In these Greek words, the root is always a noun and -o- is the combining vowel for all declensions of Greek nouns. However, when new names for fields of study are coined in modern English, the formations ending in -logy almost always add an -o-, except when the root word ends in an "l" or a vowel, as in these exceptions: analogy, dekalogy, disanalogy, genealogy, genethlialogy, herbalogy (a variant of herbology), mammalogy, mineralogy, paralogy, petralogy (a variant of petrology); elogy; antilogy, festilogy; trilogy, tetralogy, pentalogy; palillogy, pyroballogy; dyslogy; eulogy; and brachylogy. Linguists sometimes jokingly refer to haplology as haplogy (subjecting the word haplology to the process of haplology itself).
1855	The suffix -ly in English is usually a contraction of -like, similar to the Anglo-Saxon lice and German lich.  It is commonly added to an adjective to form an adverb, but in some cases it is used to form an adjective, such as ugly or manly.  When "-ly" is used to form an adjective, it is attached to a noun instead of an adjective (i.e., friendly, lovely). The adjective to which the suffix is added may have been lost from the language, as  in the case of early, in which the Anglo-Saxon word aer only survives in the poetic usage ere.
1856	When the suffix is added to a word ending in double l, no additional l is added; for example, full becomes fully. Note also wholly (from whole), which may be pronounced either with a single l sound (like holy) or with a doubled (geminate) l. When the suffix is added to a word ending in a consonant followed by le (pronounced as a syllabic l), generally the e is dropped, the l loses its syllabic nature, and no additional l is added; this category is mostly composed of adverbs that end in -ably or -ibly (and correspond to adjectives ending in -able or -ible), but it also includes other words such as nobly, feebly, triply, and idly. However, there are a few words where this contraction is not always applied, such as brittlely.
1857	In a paper war of 1604–7 between Andrew Willet and Richard Parkes, part of the Descensus controversy, the formation of terms with -mastix as suffix was discussed, Willet having initially addressed Parkes in a pamphlet Limbo-mastix. Parkes affected to be unimpressed with the play on limbo, and Willet coined Loidoromastix for him, a "scourge for a railer". By 1623 and the Latin play Fucus Histriomastix the formation of hybrid words, Dog Latin and literary nonsense with the suffix seems to have been established. The term had apparently become generic for satire by the 1660s, when schoolboys wrote "a mastix" against the schoolmaster Thomas Grantham.
1858	Three noted English poets were writing satirical verse by the later 1590s: John Donne, Joseph Hall, and John Marston. Donne used a -mastix construction, "female-mastix", to refer to Baptista Mantuanus (Mantuan), reputedly a misogynist based on his fourth eclogue, in his Elegy XIV. Hall's Virgidemiarum Six Bookes of 1597–8 contains a boast that he was the first English satirist; virgidemia translates from Latin as a "harvest of rods". The revival of satire lasted until the Bishops' Ban of 1599, in which the ecclesiastical authorities clamped down, with book burning applied to works of Everard Guilpin, Marston, William Rankins and others.
1859	The first genus to be given the suffix -monas was Pseudomonas, a genus of gammaproteobacteria. The generic epithet Pseudomonas was coined by Walter Migula in 1894, who did not give an etymology.Since the 7th edition of Bergey's manual (=top authority in bacterial nomenclature), other authors have given the etymology to be: Greek pseudēs (ψευδής, false) and monas (μονάς, single unit or monad), which can mean "false unit". However, "false unit" conceptually does not make much sense, namely, it does not mean "an organism which may falsely appear as a single unit but it is not" as it is not found in multicellular chains nor was it ever described as such. One speculation is that the name was chosen simply out of aesthetics, while the most plausible theory states that Migula intended it as false Monas, a nanoflagellate protist (Chrysophyceae: Ochromonadales: Ochromonadaceae: Chrysomonadida: Ochromonadidae). Subsequently, the term "monas" was used in the early history of microbiology to denote single-celled organisms.
1860	In English to make a vernacular name for members of a genus, i.e. trivialising the scientific name, the scientific name is taken and written with sentence case and in roman type (i.e. "standard") as opposed to uppercase italic, the plurals are generally constructed by adding an "s", regardless of Greco-Roman grammar. In the case of genera ending in monas the ending is changed to monad with plural -monads. Example: a member of the genus Pseudomonas is a pseudomonad, while two are pseudomonads. The use of the stem for non-nominative cases is seen more often in botany, where trivialisation is more common, e.g. a bromeliad is a member of the genus Bromelia.
1861	For example, onomastic terms like toponym and linguonym are typical classical (or neoclassical) compounds, formed from suffix -onym and classical (Greek and Latin) root words (Ancient Greek: τόπος / place; Latin: lingua / language). In some compounds, the -onym morpheme has been modified by replacing (or dropping) the "o". In the compounds like ananym and metanym, the correct forms (anonym and metonym) were pre-occupied by other meanings. Other, late 20th century examples, such as hypernym and characternym, are typically incorrectly formed neologisms, for which there are more traditional words formed in -onym (hyperonym and charactonym).
1862	According to a 1988 study of words ending in -onym, there are four discernible classes of -onym words: (1) historic, classic, or, for want of better terms, naturally occurring or common words; (2) scientific terminology, occurring in particular in linguistics, onomastics, etc.; (3) language games; and (4) nonce words. Older terms are known to gain new, sometimes contradictory, meanings (e.g., eponym and cryptonym). In many cases, two or more words describe the same phenomenon, but no precedence is discernible (e.g., necronym and penthonym). New words are sometimes created, the meaning of which duplicating existing terms. On occasion, new words are formed with little regard to historical principles.
1863	The Indo-Iranian word has a Slavic counterpart in the form of Proto-Slavic *stanъ. In Russian, стан (stan) means "settlement" or "semi-permanent camp". In Polish, Belarusian and Ukrainian, stan means "state" or "condition". In Serbian, Croatian and  Macedonian it translates as "apartment" in its modern usage, while its original meaning was "habitat". The Slovene word, "stanovanje", referring to an apartment or other closed space of living, is an obvious derivative of stan. In Czech and Slovak, it means "tent" or, in military terms, "headquarters". In Bulgarian, it means "a camp", usually associated with nomadic semi-permanent settlements or military camps. In Romanian, stână (a Slavic loanword) refers to a temporary or semi-permanent settlement used for sheep and herds of other domestic animals.
1864	The form of demonym used by some epigraphs in the Iberian language found in coins is -ken or -sken, as in Ikalesken, which is unrelated to the Latin-Hispanic -tanus. This suggests that -tania may be a denomination of Roman origin. According to the historian and archaeologist Manuel Gómez-Moreno, the Latin suffix -tani corresponds to the Iberian -scen, For example, the Ausetanians (Ausetani) who called themselves Ausesken. The Romans also applied this suffix to other peoples of the western Mediterranean (Sardinia and Sicily), and to a lesser extent to those of the Italian Peninsula, where however the suffix -ates prevails. Before Roman contact with the Iberian peoples, there were already Greek colonies in Iberia. The ancient Greeks used the older suffix -ητες (-etes), -εται or -ηται (-etai), which would be replaced by -ητανοι or -ετανοι (-etani), according to researcher Ulrich Schmoll (1953).
1865	The suffix originated in a dialect of Noongar, an Indigenous Australian language, in which "-up" means "place of".  The suffix "-in" or "-ing" has a similar meaning in a related dialect of Noongar. Places tended to be named after their distinctive features, whereby the place names could be used to create a "mental map" allowing Indigenous Australians to determine where water, food and other raw materials could be found. These sites were often located near sources of fresh water, leading to the common misconception that "up" and "in" mean "near water".
1866	A number of these places were at one stage named with a suffix "-upp". This was as a result of the Western Australian Lands and Surveys Department adopting a system of spelling Indigenous Australian names devised by the Royal Geographical Society. In simple terms, the system set the pronunciation of consonants as in English and vowels as in Italian. Using this system meant that "up" would be pronounced  oop, whereas the names were meant to be pronounced  up. The solution was deemed to be that doubling the following consonant would shorten the preceding vowel, thus "upp". This spelling convention was rescinded for towns in south west Western Australia in 1915 as the Australian pronunciation of "u" was almost always short.
1867	 Our English salt supply is chiefly derived from the Cheshire and Worcestershire salt-regions, which are of triassic age. Many of the places at which the salt is mined have names ending in wich, such as Northwich, Middlewich, Nantwich, Droitwich, Netherwich, and Shirleywich. This termination wich is itself curiously significant, as Canon Isaac Taylor has shown, of the necessary connection between salt and the sea. The earliest known way of producing salt was of course in shallow pans on the sea-shore, at the bottom of a shoal bay, called in Norse and Early English a wick or wich; and the material so produced is still known in trade as bay-salt. By-and-by, when people came to discover the inland brine-pits and salt mines, they transferred to them the familiar name, a wich; and the places where the salt was manufactured came to be known as wych-houses. Droitwich, for example, was originally such a wich, where the droits or dues on salt were paid at the time when William the Conqueror's commissioners drew up their great survey for Domesday Book. But the good, easy-going mediæval people who gave these quaint names to the inland wiches had probably no idea that they were really and truly dried-up bays, and that the salt they mined from their pits was genuine ancient bay-salt, the deposit of an old inland sea, evaporated by slow degrees a countless number of ages since, exactly as the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake are getting evaporated in our own time. 
1868	Knuth's digit grouping is exponential instead of linear; each division doubles the number of digits handled, whereas the familiar system only adds three or six more.  His system is basically the same as one of the ancient and now-unused Chinese numeral systems, in which units stand for 104, 108, 1016, 1032, ..., 102n, and so on (with an exception that the -yllion proposal does not use a word for thousand which the original Chinese numeral system has). Today the corresponding characters are used for 104, 108, 1012, 1016, and so on.
1869	Each new number name is the square of the previous one — therefore, each new name covers twice as many digits. Knuth continues borrowing the traditional names changing "illion" to "yllion" on each one. Abstractly, then, "one n-yllion" is      10   2  n + 2       {\displaystyle 10^{2^{n+2}}} . "One trigintyllion" (     10   2  32       {\displaystyle 10^{2^{32}}} ) would have 232 + 1, or 42;9496,7297, or nearly forty-three myllion (4300 million) digits (by contrast, a conventional "trigintillion" has merely 94 digits — not even a hundred, let alone a thousand million, and still 7 digits short of a googol). Better yet, "one centyllion" (     10   2  102       {\displaystyle 10^{2^{102}}} ) would have 2102 + 1, or 507,0602;4009,1291:7605,9868;1282,1505, or about 1/20 of a tryllion digits, whereas a conventional "centillion" has only 304 digits.
1870	The suffix follows IUPAC nomenclature, and is mainly used in organic chemistry.  However, inorganic compounds featuring unsaturation in the form of triple bonds may be denoted by substitutive nomenclature with the same methods used with alkynes, i.e., the name of thecorresponding saturated hydride is modified by replacing the "-ane" ending with "-yne". The suffix "-diyne" is used when there are two triple bonds, and so on. The position of unsaturation is indicated by a numerical locant immediately preceding the "-yne" suffix, or locants in the case of multiple triple bonds. Locants are chosen to be as low as possible. While generally used as a suffix, "-yne" is also used as an infix to name substituent groups that are triply bound to the parent compound.
1871	..."Let Me Sing" was recorded in five separate recording sessions between August 20, 1961, and May 29, 1963, at the Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville, Tennessee, United States under the direction of producer Owen Bradley. ..."Let Me Sing" contained twelve tracks like all of her previous albums and contained many cover versions of Pop music songs and standards. The album remakes included "Night and Day" by Cole Porter, Bobby Darin's "You're the Reason I'm Leaving", "At Last" which was recently covered by Etta James, and "End of the World" by Skeeter Davis. Unlike Lee's previous release of 1963, ..."Let Me Sing" contained more recent cover versions of pop songs, mainly from the late 1950s and early 1960s. Greg Adams of AllMusic called the album's use of Pop standards to sound "fresh" unlike her prior releases. Adams reviewed the album and gave it three out of five stars. Adams stated, "..."Let Me Sing" manages to sound vital where very similar albums failed later in her career. Not surprisingly, Let Me Sing was also Lee's second-to-last Top 40 album." The album was originally released on a 33⅓ rpm LP record upon its initial release, containing six songs on the "A-side" of the record and six songs on the "B-side" of the record. The album has since been reissued on a compact disc in both Paraguay and Japan.
1872	..."Let Me Sing" released its first single over a year before its initial release. The first single "Break It to Me Gently" was released in January 1962, peaking at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #46 on the UK Singles Chart in the United Kingdom. Its second single "Losing You" was released one year later in April 1963. The single peaked at #6 on the Billboard Hot 100, #2 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart, and #13 on the Billboard R&B chart. It became Lee's last single to chart on the R&B chart during her recording career. The single would also reach #10 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was officially released on December 9, 1963, on Decca Records, later peaking at #39 on the Billboard 200 albums chart.
1873	Aldrich says his son suggested Peter Falk, best known for Columbo. "I gave him the Bette Davis speech - a great hook for any actor," said Aldrich, referring to a technique he used to get Davis to star in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane. "It goes like this: 'Peter if this isn't the best script ever written for you put it in an envelope and sent it right back. But if it is the best, then lets make it. I don't want you to hear that you don't like that speech on page 16. It's either the best or it isn't. That rarely fails. You don't always get the picture made but you always get a positive reaction. Nobody's ego can withstand that sort of flattery."
1874	One of the final women who auditioned was Vicki Fredrick, who appeared on Broadway in A Chorus Line and Dancin'. She remembers "There was incredible tension," at the end. "On graduation day, each girl did a five-minute match for the heads of MGM, and Mr. Aldrich and Peter Falk. Laurene Landon [a Canadian athletic fashion model] and I got the parts, and the other two girls didn't get anything. It was a win-lose situation. When Mr. Aldrich told me he wanted me to play Iris, he also said he wanted me to put on 10 pounds. 'You have a dancer's body,' he said, 'and you have to look like a lady wrestler.'"
1875	Aldrich said "I hope this is going to be a fun picture, not a Big Knife, but then I thought Emperor of the North Pole was a fun picture, but nobody saw it, so maybe I was wrong. I'm not so sure what a fun picture is anymore, just as I no longer know what fun is, at least in this town. There's no working class any more in the industry. Every grip owns two or three apartments. It's just a job now for everybody. They leave the set, go to the bank, and then go home. No fun anymore. Let's hope this one will be." 
1876	...Allow Us to Be Frank, a Rat Pack tribute, is the fifth studio album, sixth major album release under Sony BMG and first cover album by Irish boy band Westlife; it is also the first album since the departure of Brian McFadden and as a four-piece. It was released on 8 November 2004, and peaked at number two in Ireland and number three in the United Kingdom. ...Allow Us To Be Frank was number twenty-four on the 2004 year-end album charts. The album features songs made popular by Frank Sinatra such as "The Way You Look Tonight", "Come Fly with Me", "Moon River", "Summer Wind" and "That's Life". It also includes the Nat "King" Cole song, "When I Fall in Love". It was recorded with a 60-piece orchestra at Phoenix Studios in Wembley, in the London Borough of Brent.
1877	The album's lead single, "Turn Me On 'Mr. Deadman'", proved key in its success and held on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for six months. The song jabs at the rock star image and found its title from a myth surrounding the Beatles song "Revolution 9". It would go on to become The Union Underground's best known song and received both significant radio play and MTV rotation thanks to its music video. Because of the single, An Education in Rebellion also made AN's Hottest Sales Nationwide chart. It was later featured on the 2001 compilations Corrosion and KROQ New Music. "Killing the Fly" peaked at #13 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks while the final single, "Revolution Man," reached #26 and became an Active Rock top 30 hit. A live performance of "South Texas Deathride" was included on Ozzfest 2001: The Second Millennium.
1878	In promoting ...An Education in Rebellion, The Union Underground began headlining the Road Rage tour, with opening acts Linkin Park and Systematic, prior to the album's release. They headlined club dates in fall 2000 and joined Marilyn Manson in late October. According to the band, Manson heard "Turn Me on 'Mr. Deadman'" in a strip club and subsequently hand picked The Union Underground as his tour mates. The next year, they performed on the SnoCore Tour, Ozzfest 2001 in both the United States and Europe, and various festivals in Germany, London, and Paris. To correspond with the excitement of their live show, the band incorporated a large video screen depicting footage pieced together by the band members themselves to play in sync with the song rhythms.
1879	Sun is in South Korea, set up on a date by a matchmaker, and finds her prospective suitor, Jae Lee, to be wealthy, educated, and charming. Meanwhile, Jin is preparing for an important job interview at a hotel. His roommate, using what appears to be the I Ching, tells him that Jin will find love soon, adding cryptically that its color will be orange. Jin's interviewer, Mr. Kim, berates Jin as a bumpkin villager who stinks of fish, but then hires him as a doorman anyway, with a stern warning that Jin is not to open the door to anyone like himself. Sun and Jae continue to hit it off, and the pair schedule a meeting at the hotel where Jin is working and which Jae's family owns. Sun heads for the entrance of the hotel, but Jin fails to see her because he is bowing as he opens the door for her. Inside, Jae suddenly reveals that he plans to marry a woman he met in America, and has been seeing Sun only to placate his parents. Although she is obviously disappointed, Sun wishes him well and leaves. A poorly dressed father with a young boy approaches the hotel, and asks Jin for permission to enter, as the boy urgently has to go to the bathroom. Jin reluctantly lets the pair inside, but Mr. Kim observes this, and gives him a stern dressing-down, again insulting his background. Jin quits on the spot. Later, wandering along a bridge, Jin passes a woman in an orange dress. Looking back wistfully, he shakes his head in amusement, and turns around. He collides directly with Sun, thus meeting his future wife for the first time.
1880	At the beach, Sun has discovered that she has lost her wedding ring. Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) offers to help Sun look for the ring, which Sun declines. Later, when Sun is angrily tearing apart her garden, John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) arrives. Sun states that she does not remember ever seeing him angry. Locke laughs and replies that he used to be angry often. Sun asks him why he no longer becomes angry, and he replies that he is not lost any more. Sun asks him how he found himself. Locke answers, "The same way anything lost gets found: I stopped looking."
1881	Arthur Kirkland, a defense attorney in Baltimore, is in jail on a contempt of court charge after punching Judge Henry T. Fleming while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh. McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offense, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Arthur's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses his appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison.
1882	Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer. Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford, who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse and an M1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up.
1883	Arthur's friend and partner, Jay Porter, is also unstable. He feels guilt for gaining acquittals for defendants who were truly guilty of violent crimes, and shows up drunk at Arthur's apartment after one of his clients kills two kids after his acquittal. After a violent breakdown at the courthouse, wherein he ends up throwing plates at people, Jay is taken to a hospital. Before leaving in the ambulance, Arthur asks Warren Fresnell, another partner, to handle Ralph Agee's court hearing in his absence. Arthur gives Warren a corrected version of Ralph's probation report and stresses that it must be shown to the judge so that Ralph will get probation rather than jail time.
1884	Unfortunately, Warren shows up late and forgets to give the judge the corrected version causing Ralph to be sentenced to jail. Arthur is livid and attacks Warren's car. When Warren argues that Ralph's trial was nothing but "nickels and dimes" and beneath him, Arthur reminds him that "they're people!" He then reveals that 30 minutes after he was sentenced, Ralph committed suicide by hanging himself. Meanwhile, Jeff, sexually and physically abused by other inmates, finally snaps and takes two hostages. Arthur pleads with him to surrender, promising to get him out, but a police sniper shoots and kills Jeff when he moves in front of a window.
1885	A clearly disturbed Arthur takes on Judge Fleming's case. He tries to talk the prosecuting attorney, Frank Bowers, into throwing the case out but Bowers, who recognizes the prestige that convicting a judge would earn him, refuses to back down. Arthur meets with another client, Carl, who gives him photographs that show Fleming engaged in BDSM acts with a prostitute. Gail warns Arthur not to betray a client, revealing that the ethics committee has been keeping their eye on him ever since the contempt of court incident. He shows the pictures to Fleming, who freely admits he is guilty of the rape.
1886	As the trial opens, Fleming, while looking at the victim, makes a casual remark to Arthur that he "wouldn't mind seeing her again sometime." Arthur's face indicates his disgust. In his opening statement, Arthur begins by mocking Bowers' case while speculating on the ultimate objective of the American legal system. He appears to be making a strong case to exonerate Fleming – but then, unexpectedly, he bursts out that the prosecution is not going to get Fleming, because he is going to get him and declares that his client is guilty. Judge Rayford yells that Arthur is "out of order," to which Arthur retorts, "You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order! They're out of order!" Arthur is dragged out of the courtroom, venting his rage all the way and condemning Fleming for his and the legal system's abuse of the law. As the courtroom spectators (including Gail) cheer for Arthur, Fleming sits down in defeat, and a fed-up Rayford storms out.
1887	...And Justice for All opened to critical acclaim and box office success. Produced on a modest budget of $4 million, it grossed over $33.3 million in North America, making it the 24th highest-grossing film of 1979. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning an 80% rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 30 reviews. Brian W. Fairbanks in the book The Late Show called the film's screenplay "overly contrived", despite Pacino's "trademark" phrase in the courtroom. Zagat gave the film 23 of 30 possible points overall; the quality of acting a score of 26 of 30, and story and production 22 each, where 20 to 25 represents "very good to excellent"; 26 to 30 "extraordinary to perfection". The Empire magazine called it a "solid but slightly clichéd courtroom drama" and rated it three stars out of five.
1888	Homer Simpson's bedroom rant to Marge in The Simpsons episode "Secrets of a Successful Marriage" is a parody mishmash of four popular films: ...And Justice for All, A Few Good Men, Patton, and Chinatown. He says: "Look, Marge, you don't know what it's like. I'm the one out there every day putting his ass on the line. And I'm not out of order! You're out of order. The whole freaking system is out of order. You want the truth? You want the truth?! You can't handle the truth! 'Cause when you reach over and put your hand into a pile of goo that was your best friend's face, you'll know what to do! Forget it, Marge, it's Chinatown!"
1889	Metallica recorded the album with producer Flemming Rasmussen over four months in early 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. It features aggressive complexity, fast tempos, and few verse-chorus structures. It contains lyrical themes of political and legal injustices, such as governmental corruption, censorship, and war. The cover, designed by Stephen Gorman based on a concept by Metallica guitarist James Hetfield and drummer Lars Ulrich, depicts Lady Justice bound in ropes. The album title is derived from the American Pledge of Allegiance. Three of its songs were released as singles: "Harvester of Sorrow", "Eye of the Beholder", and "One"; the title track was released as a promotional single.
1890	...And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics for its depth and complexity, although its dry mix and nearly inaudible bass was criticized. It was included in The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics' poll of the year's best albums, and was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1989, controversially losing out to Jethro Tull in the ill-fated Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental category. The single "One" backed the band's debut music video, and earned Metallica their first Grammy Award in 1990 (and the first ever in the Best Metal Performance category). It was the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the United States, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200, and was certified 8× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2003 for shipping eight million copies in the U.S.
1891	...And Justice for All was recorded from January to May 1988 at One on One Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Metallica produced the album with Flemming Rasmussen. He had been initially unavailable for the planned start on January 1, 1988, and the band hired Mike Clink, who had caught their attention for producing the debut Guns N' Roses album Appetite for Destruction (1987). Plans deteriorated, and Rasmussen became available three weeks after drummer Lars Ulrich had first called him. Rasmussen listened to Clink's rough mixes for the album on his February 14 flight to Los Angeles, and upon his arrival, Clink was fired. Hetfield explained that recording with Clink had been problematic, and Rasmussen was a last-minute replacement. Clink is credited with engineering drums on "The Shortest Straw" and "Harvester of Sorrow". Awaiting Rasmussen's arrival, the band had recorded two cover songs—"Breadfan" and "The Prince"—to "fine‑tune the sound while they got into the studio vibe". Both were released as B-sides for singles from the album and were later included on the 1998 cover album Garage Inc.
1892	Rasmussen's first task was to adjust and arrange the guitar sound, with which the band was dissatisfied. A guide track for the tempos and a click track for Ulrich's drumming were used. The band played in a live room, recording the instruments separately. Each song used three reels: one for drums, a second for bass and guitars, and a third for other parts. Hetfield wrote lyrics during the recording sessions; these were occasionally unfinished as recording began, and Rasmussen said that Hetfield "wasn't really interested in singing" but instead "wanted that hard vibe". Metallica's recording process was new to Newsted, who questioned his impact on the overall sound and the lack of discussion with the rest of the team. He recorded his parts separately, with only the assistant engineer present. The experience differed from his previous band, Flotsam and Jetsam, whose style he described as "basically everybody playing the same thing like a sonic wall".
1893	Critic Simon Reynolds noted the riff changes and experimentation with timing on the album's intricately constructed songs: "The tempo shifts, gear changes, lapses, decelerations and abrupt halts". BBC Music's Eamonn Stack wrote that ...And Justice for All sounds different from the band's previous albums, with longer songs, sparser arrangements, and harsher vocals by Hetfield. According to journalist Martin Popoff, the album is less melodic than its predecessors because of its frequent tempo changes, unusual song structures and layered guitars. He argued that the album is more of a progressive metal record because of its intricately performed music and bleak sound. Music writer Joel McIver called the album's music aggressive enough for Metallica to maintain its place with bands "at the mellower end of extreme metal". According to writer Christopher Knowles, Metallica took "the thrash concept to its logical conclusion" on the album.
1894	The album was noted for its "dry, sterile" production. Rasmussen said that was not his intention, as he tried for an ambient sound similar to the previous two albums. He was not present during the album's mixing, for which Steve Thompson and Michael Barbiero had been hired beforehand. Rasmussen assumed that, in his absence from the mixing process, Thompson and Barbiero used only the close microphones on the mix and none of the room microphones, thus causing the "clicking", thin drum sound. The bass guitar is nearly inaudible, while the guitars sound "strangled mechanistic". He saw the "synthetic" percussion as another reason for the album's compressed sound.
1895	At the instruction of Hetfield and Ulrich, Newsted's bass guitar was made almost inaudible. According to Rasmussen: "After Lars and James heard their initial mixes the first thing they said was, 'Take the bass down so you can just hear it, and then once you've done that take it down a further three dBs.' I have no idea why they wanted that, but it was totally out of my hands." In 2009, Hetfield said that the bass was obscured as the basslines often doubled his rhythm guitar, making the instruments indiscernible, and because the low frequencies were competing in the mix with his "scooped", bassy guitar sound.
1896	In 2019, Hetfield and Ulrich said they had mixed the bass low not to belittle Newsted, but because their hearing was "shot" following heavy touring and they "basically kept turning everything else up until the bass disappeared". They decided not to adjust the mix for the remastered 2019 reissue, saying: "These records are a product of a certain time in life; they’re snapshots of history and they’re part of our story … And Justice for All could use a little more low end and St. Anger could use a little less tin snare drum, but those things are what make those records part of our history."
1897	The album title was revealed in April 1988: ...And Justice for All, after the final words of the Pledge of Allegiance. The lyrics address political and legal injustice as seen through the prism of war (including nuclear war) and censored speech. The majority of the songs raise issues that differ from the violent retaliation of the previous releases. Tom King writes that for the first time the lyrics dealt with political and environmental issues. He named contemporaries Nuclear Assault as the only other band who applied ecological lyrics to thrash metal songs rather than singing about Satan and Egyptian plagues. McIver noted that Hetfield, the band's main lyricist, wrote about topics that he had not addressed before, such as his revolt against the establishment. Ulrich described the songwriting process as their "CNN years", with him and Hetfield watching the channel in search for song subjects—"I'd read about the blacklisting thing, we'd get a title, 'The Shortest Straw,' and a song would come out of that."
1898	Concerns about the state of the environment ("Blackened"), corruption ("And Justice for All"), and blacklisting and discrimination ("The Shortest Straw") are emphasized with traditional existential themes. Issues such as freedom of speech and civil liberties ("Eye of the Beholder") are presented from a grim and pessimistic point of view. "One" was unofficially nicknamed an "antiwar anthem" for its lyrics, which portray the suffering of a wounded soldier. "Dyers Eve" is a lyrical rant from Hetfield to his parents. Burton received co-writing credit on "To Live Is to Die" as the bass line is a medley of unused recordings Burton had performed prior to his death. Because the original recordings are not used on the track, the composition is credited as written by Burton and played by Newsted. The spoken word section of the song was erroneously attributed in its entirety to Burton in the liner notes. The first line was actually written by German poet Paul Gerhardt ("When a man lies, he murders some part of the world.") while the second line comes from Lord Foul's Bane, a fantasy novel by American writer Stephen R. Donaldson ("These are the pale deaths which men miscall their lives."). The second half of the speech ("All this I cannot bear to witness any longer. Cannot the kingdom of salvation take me home?") was written by Burton.
1899	Released on September 7, 1988, by Elektra Records, ...And Justice for All was acclaimed by music critics. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Michael Azerrad said that Metallica's compositions are impressive and called the album's music "a marvel of precisely channeled aggression". Spin magazine's Sharon Liveten called it a "gem of a double record" and found the music both edgy and technically proficient. Simon Reynolds, writing in Melody Maker, said that "other bands would give their eye teeth" for the songs' riffs and found the album's densely complicated style of metal to be distinct from the monotonous sound of contemporary rock music: "Everything depends on utter punctuality and supreme surgical finesse. It's probably the most incisive music I've ever heard, in the literal sense of the word." Borivoj Krgin of Metal Forces said that it was the most ideal album he has heard because of typically exceptional production and musicianship that is more impressive than that of Master of Puppets. In a less enthusiastic review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau believed that the band's compositions lack song form and that the album "goes on longer" than Master of Puppets. In 1988, ...And Justice for All was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance, but controversially lost to Jethro Tull's Crest of a Knave. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly, named this one of the 10 biggest upsets in Grammy history.
1900	In a retrospective review, Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said that ...And Justice for All was both the band's "most ambitious" and ultimately "flattest-sounding" album. AllMusic's Steve Huey noted that Metallica followed the blueprint of the previous two albums, with more sophisticated songs and "apocalyptic" lyrics that envisioned a society in decay. Music journalist Mick Wall was critical of the progressive elements on the album and believed that, apart from "One" and "Dyers Eve", most of the album sounded clumsy. Colin Larkin, writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music (2006), wrote that, apart from the praiseworthy "One", the album diminished the band's creativity by concentrating the songs with too many riffs. Ulrich said in retrospect that the album has improved with time and it is well-liked among their contemporaries.
1901	In The Village Voice's annual Pazz & Jop critics poll, it was voted the 39th best album of 1988, having received 117 votes, including 12 first-place votes. The album was ranked at number nine on IGN's "Top 25 Metal Albums". Guitar World lists it 12th on the "100 Greatest Guitar Albums" from a 2006 reader poll, and lists all of its tracks on "The 100 Greatest Metallica Songs of All Time". Kerrang! listed the album at number 42 among the "100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time". Martin Popoff ranks it at number 19 in his book The Top 500 Heavy Metal Albums of All Time, the fourth highest ranked Metallica album on the list. It is featured in Robert Dimery's 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In 2017, it was ranked 21st on Rolling Stone's list of "100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time".
1902	After years of refusing to release music videos, Metallica released its first for "One". The video was controversial among fans, who had valued the band's apparent opposition to MTV and other forms of mainstream music. Slant Magazine ranked it number 48 on their list of the "100 Greatest Music Videos", saying that Metallica "evoke a revolution of the soul far more devastating than that presented in the original text". The guitar solo was ranked number seven in Guitar World's compilation of the "100 Greatest Guitar Solos" of all time. Additionally, heavy metal website Noisecreep classed the song ninth among the "10 Best '80s Metal Songs".
1903	Although Metallica's music was considered unappealing for mainstream radio, ...And Justice for All became the first underground metal album to achieve chart success in the US. It became Metallica's best-selling album upon release, peaking at number six on the Billboard 200, where it charted for 83 weeks. More than 8,000,000 copies have been sold in the United States since 1991, when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales. It was certified platinum nine weeks after it was released in stores, and 1.7 million copies were sold in the US by the end of 1988. Since its release, the album has scanned more than 8 million copies in the US and, according to MTV's Chris Harris, "helped cement [Metallica's] status as a rock and roll force to be reckoned with". Classic Rock explained that with this album, Metallica received substantial media exposure, becoming a multi-platinum act by 1990. The group broke through on radio in early 1989 with "One", which was released as the third single from the record. According to Billboard, the accompanying Damaged Justice Tour evolved the band into arena headliners, while significant airplay was garnered by "One" and by the group's first music video.
1904	...And Justice for All achieved similar chart success outside the United States. It topped the charts in Finland, peaked within the top 5 on the charts in Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom, and remained on the UK chart for six weeks. The album managed to peak in the top 10 on the Norwegian and Swiss album charts. It was less successful in Spain, Mexico, and France, where it peaked at number 92 on the former chart, number 130 on the latter, and number 64 in Spain. ...And Justice for All received a three times platinum certification from Music Canada for shipping 300,000 copies, a platinum certification from IFPI Finland for having a shipment of little over 50,000 copies, and was certified gold by the Bundesverband Musikindustrie (BVMI) for shipments of 250,000 copies. It was awarded gold by the British Phonographic Industry in 2013 for shipping 100,000 copies in the UK. ...And Justice for All was surpassed commercially by the band's following album, Metallica (1991).
1905	Guitarist Kirk Hammett noted that the length of the songs was problematic for fans and for the band: "Touring behind it, we realized that the general consensus was that songs were too fucking long. One day after we played Justice and got off the stage one of us said, 'we're never fucking playing that song again.'" Nevertheless, "One" quickly became a permanent fixture in the band's setlist. When performed live, the opening war sound is lengthened from seventeen seconds to approximately two minutes. At the song's conclusion, the stage turns pitch-black and fire erupts from around the stage. The live performance is characterized as a "musical and visual highlight" by Rolling Stone journalist Denise Sheppard. Other songs from ...And Justice for All that have frequently been performed are "Blackened" and "Harvester of Sorrow", which were often featured during the album's promotional Damaged Justice Tour.
1906	Metallica played the title track in the opening show of the Sick of the Studio '07 tour, for the first time since October 1989, and made it a set-fixture for the remainder of that tour. A statue of Lady Justice is commonly placed on the scene, to be torn down as the song approaches its conclusion. "Eye of the Beholder" has not been played live since 1989; one such performance appears on Metallica's live extended play Six Feet Down Under. In 2009, "The Shortest Straw" returned to the setlist during the World Magnetic Tour after a 12-year absence, and has been sporadically performed since. "Dyers Eve" debuted live in 2004, sixteen years after it was recorded, during the Madly in Anger with the World Tour at The Forum in Inglewood, California. "To Live Is to Die" premiered at the band's 30th-anniversary concert in 2011 at The Fillmore in San Francisco. "The Frayed Ends of Sanity", the last song on the album to be performed live, debuted live in Helsinki on the Metallica By Request tour in 2014, although the band had previously played segments during solos, impromptu jams, or in a "Justice" medley.
1907	SNFU formed in November 1981, but recorded only demo and compilation material in their first three years together.  They first became associated with BYO Records in July 1983 when they shared a short Canadian tour with Youth Brigade, the American punk band the members of which ran the label.  BYO offered SNFU a spot on their forthcoming compilation album Something to Believe In, due for release in early 1984.  SNFU recorded the song "Victims of the Womanizer" at Mid Ocean Studios in Winnipeg in November 1983 for the compilation.  When the track received much positive attention, BYO signed SNFU to a record deal.
1908	His prayers are granted, though ironically – when his older brother is drafted his father needs an extra body and grudgingly allows Miguel to accompany them.  Miguel is miserable with the manner in which his wish has been granted, and confesses to his brother what he prayed for.  His brother explains that he had been praying to leave New Mexico and see more of the world – while he is not happy about being drafted, he fatalistically accepts that it is the only way he is likely to be able to fulfill his dream.  The brothers resolve to allow God to work freely for the rest of their lives, and not bother God with petty requests.
1909	...And Out Come the Wolves is the third studio album by American punk rock band Rancid. It was released on August 22, 1995, through Epitaph Records. Rancid's popularity and catchy songs made them the subject of a major label bidding war (hence the title, ...And Out Come the Wolves taken from a poem in Jim Carroll's The Basketball Diaries) that ended with the band staying on Epitaph. With a sound heavily influenced by ska, which called to mind Tim Armstrong and Matt Freeman's past in Operation Ivy, Rancid became one of the few bands of the mid-to late-1990s boom in punk rock to retain much of its original fanbase. In terms of record sales and certifications, …And Out Come the Wolves is a popular album in the United States. It produced three hit singles: "Roots Radicals", "Time Bomb" and "Ruby Soho", that earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. All the singles charted on Modern Rock Tracks. …And Out Come the Wolves was certified gold by the RIAA on January 22, 1996. It was certified platinum on September 23, 2004.
1910	Rancid formed in Albany, California, in 1991. They signed to Epitaph Records (founded by Bad Religion guitarist Brett Gurewitz) in 1992 and released their eponymous debut album, Rancid, a year later to rave reviews. While Rancid was already writing another album, Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong, one of the band's friends, joined them to co-write the song "Radio". This led to him playing a live show with the band, and Rancid frontman Tim Armstrong eventually asked him to become a member of the band, but he decided to continue playing in Green Day. Armstrong had previously asked Lars Frederiksen to be Rancid's second guitarist, but he turned down the request. After Billie Joe declined, Frederiksen changed his mind and decided to join the band. Rancid's second album, Let's Go, was released in 1994 to unexpected success and acclaim. After the release of Green Day's Dookie and The Offspring's Smash later that year, Rancid was pursued by several major labels, including Madonna's Maverick Records, but eventually turned them down. They decided to stay on Epitaph and soon began recording a follow-up album.
1911	The album received positive reviews, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as having "classic moments of revivalist punk". Erlewine praised the music and claims the album "doesn't mark an isolationist retreat into didactic, defiantly underground punk rock". The album received a rating of four and a half out of five stars, while "Time Bomb," "Ruby Soho" and "Roots Radicals" earned Rancid its heaviest airplay on MTV and radio stations to date. In 2005, ...And Out Come the Wolves was ranked number 368 in Rock Hard magazine's book of The 500 Greatest Rock & Metal Albums of All Time. BuzzFeed included the album at number 14 on their "36 Pop Punk Albums You Need To Hear Before You F——ing Die" list.
1912	Nelson moved to Nashville in 1960, but no label signed him. Most of his demos were rejected. Nelson was later signed as a songwriter to Pamper Music with the help of Hank Cochran, who worked for the publishing company owned by Ray Price and Hal Smith. Faron Young recorded Nelson's "Hello Walls", and after Ray Price recorded Nelson's "Night Life", and his previous bassist Johnny Paycheck quit, Nelson joined Price's touring band as a bass player. While playing with Price and the Cherokee Cowboys, other of his original songs became hits for other artists, including "Funny How Time Slips Away" (Billy Walker), "Pretty Paper" (Roy Orbison), and, most famously, "Crazy" by Patsy Cline. Nelson signed with Liberty Records and was recording by August 1961 at Quonset Hut Studio.  As Nelson later recalled, Cochran was instrumental in getting him signed: "Hank had convinced Liberty's A&R man for country music, Joe Allison, that I was the next big thing...Allison knew that there wasn't any way I was gonna change my singing style - and that was fine by him.  He understood me.  He just wanted me to sing my own songs in my own way."
1913	In his 2015 autobiography, Nelson insists that he composed "Crazy", "Night Life", "Funny How Time Slips Away", "Mr. Record Man", "I Gotta Get Drunk" and "The Party's Over" in one songwriting jag while living in Houston before finally moving to Nashville: "Within an astounding short period of time – a week or two – I'd written a suite of songs that reflected my real-life situation.  I knew these songs were damn good, but at the same time, I didn't know what to do with them."  Nelson unconsciously borrowed the first few notes of "Crazy" from the Floyd Tillman song "I Gotta Have My Baby Back."   "Hello Walls" was written after Nelson had been hired by Pamper Music.  Initially collaborating with Hank Cochran, he was nervous at first, realising "this was creativity on demand," and later recalling:
1914	The recording sessions for his first album release, ...And Then I Wrote, began in the Nashville studios of Liberty Records. Nelson recorded on August 22–23, starting during the night and lasting until the morning of the following day. Dissatisfied with the results, Allison moved the sessions to the studios of the label in Los Angeles, California, where Nelson was joined by three other stellar guitarists - session leader Billy Strange, Roy Nichols from the Maddox Brothers and Rose, and Johnny Western, who had worked with Johnny Cash. During two sessions in September 11–12, Nelson recorded "Crazy", "Darkness on the Face of the Earth", "Three Days", "Funny How Times Slips Away", "Mr. Record Man" and "Hello Walls". B. J. Baker led the vocal chorus that attempted to back Nelson, but the singer's idiosyncratic style gave them problems, as recounted by Nelson biographer Joe Nick Patoski: "The singers got lost trying to follow Willie's lead vocals until Joe Allison put up some baffles between Willie and the singers so they couldn't hear one another.  To stay on the beat, the singers followed Johnny Western's direction."  The liner notes of the album were written by local DJ Charlie Williams, by request of Allison.  The album's biggest hit was "Touch Me," a sad blues done in a slow drag with the rough edges smoothed out by harmony singers and a cool instrumental arrangement that reached the Top 10 and earned Nelson a place on jukeboxes throughput the United States.
1915	The album received mixed reviews from critics, but reached No. 3 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 14 on the US Billboard 200. The lead single "Follow You Follow Me" became their highest charting at that point, reaching No.  7 in the UK and No.  23 in the US. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 1988 for selling one million copies in the US. To further promote it, Genesis toured worldwide with their new live guitarist Daryl Stuermer. The album was remixed in 2007 as part of the Genesis 1976–1982 box set in 5.1 surround sound and a new stereo mix by Nick Davis.
1916	In July 1977, the Genesis line-up of drummer and vocalist Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hackett, and touring drummer Chester Thompson completed their tour in support of their eighth studio album, Wind & Wuthering. The band proceeded to edit and mix their second live album, Seconds Out, in August 1977, during which time Hackett left the band as he wished to pursue a solo career. He had enjoyed producing his first solo album Voyage of the Acolyte, disliked musical compromises in Genesis and felt more comfortable working as a solo artist. Since Genesis had now played Madison Square Garden, Hackett felt the group had run out of things to do. Hackett's departure was not made public until 8 October, when Collins, Banks, and Rutherford were promoting Seconds Out (and had finished working on ...And Then There Were Three...). The trio were confident they could carry on, as they had formed the backbone of several Genesis classics, including the "Apocalypse in 9/8" section of "Supper's Ready", the instrumental part of "The Cinema Show" and the basics of A Trick of the Tail (written while Hackett was working on his first solo album). Thus, they did not hire any additional or replacement members, with the three members handling most instrumental duties in the studio from this point on.
1917	Rehearsals began at Shepperton Studios for around six weeks. In September 1977, the remaining three members returned to Relight Studios in Hilvarenbeek, Netherlands to write and record their new album, the same venue as used for the Wind & Wuthering album. The group wished to record in a new location, but they could not find a studio that fit their needs and did not wish to travel too far from England. Rutherford wished to remain in London, but noted recording abroad was their "one tax concession". Joining the group was audio engineer and co-producer David Hentschel who had worked on the band's past two albums. Genesis also shared production duties and are credited on the album's sleeve. According to Rutherford, the material was recorded in two weeks. The band considered auditioning new guitarists or utilising a studio guitarist for the album, but Rutherford felt confident enough in his skills to take on the lead guitar parts himself, feeling he would enjoy the challenge of doing so. Banks noticed recording as a three-member band was an easier and more pleasurable experience than before as each member had a clearly defined role, which reduced the risk of personnel clashes along the way. Rutherford became aware that with three members, the basic tracks came across as sparse and not so easy to understand until the overdubs were recorded on top of them. Following the recording, the group mixed the album at Trident Studios in London.
1918	Banks and Rutherford remained the more dominant songwriters with four and three songs written by them respectively, one from Banks and Collins, and three tracks written by all three members. Collins had settled down with his wife and two children in South Ealing, meaning he did not find much time to bring new compositions to the sessions. Rutherford later said he was impressed the group wrote "Follow You Follow Me", as they had had difficulty writing songs that worked within a 3–4 minute framework. The majority of the album was formed of pre-written songs, not ones developed from jams and improvisations. Collins later thought the album lacked "rich, jazzy pieces" like "Los Endos" from A Trick of the Tail with its merge of rhythm and melody, but could not contribute such ideas as it was difficult to play the drums in his flat in Ealing with his wife and two children. The group were still growing in popularity in the United States and did not have a hit single, which Banks later admitted was a struggling point for them. The original album track order swapped "Undertow" with "Many Too Many" and "Scenes from a Night's Dream", before it was changed as the band felt it flowed better.
1919	The album marked a change in the band's sound, moving from their progressive rock roots towards shorter, more concise songs. The motivation for this was to be able to put more musical ideas on an album, and to act as a response to the punk rock and new wave scenes, where short and concise songs were standard. This decision made Collins realise it gave off the impression that the band were aiming to become "a singles band", but maintained the material remained "fundamentally the same". Rutherford in particular wanted to forge his own style and not copy Hackett's distinctive guitar tones, so the album was more dominated by Banks' keyboards, with sparser and simpler guitar parts.
1920	"Down and Out", one of the three tracks written collectively, was written during the band's rehearsals. Thompson found its more complex time signature difficult to reproduce on stage at first as Collins could not explain the riff and rhythm which Rutherford noted merely "added to the confusion". Collins wrote the lyrics, which concern American record labels who drop artists when they are no longer in fashion; the chorus is spoken from the artists's view and the verses from the label. The band had originally planned to develop and arrange Banks's song "Undertow" further, but its basic track of guitar, drums and piano, coupled with its simple chorus, was strong enough to keep as it was. Banks plays a Yamaha electric grand piano on the track which also incorporates voice loops made by the band that were kept "low-key and subtle" in the final mix. Banks had written a two-minute introduction to the song, but recalled disagreement from the other members as there were enough keyboard parts on the album. The section was reworked and used as a part of "From the Undertow", a track on Banks's first solo album A Curious Feeling (1979).
1921	The lyrics to "Ballad of Big" were written by Collins. The introduction contains a wobbly guitar effect created by Rutherford whereby he rubbed his guitar strings with pieces of metal, giving it a "slightly Eastern strain". The end of the track has Banks and himself duelling between the Yamaha electric piano and his Roland guitar synthesiser. For "Snowbound", Collins originally recorded his drum part at a considerably faster pace before the group decided to slow them down in order to fit the style of the song. Collins and Rutherford described it as a romantic song, with its lyrics about a man who wears a snowman outfit to hide from people but while inside, becomes paranoid and finds he cannot get out. While Banks was writing "Burning Rope", he decided to shorten the track rather than stretch its arrangements into an extended piece as he wished to avoid repeating himself and drawing comparisons to his ten-minute "One for the Vine" from Wind & Wuthering. It features a lead guitar solo from Rutherford that he found was a challenge to produce in the wake of Hackett's departure, but was pleased with the final result and called it his best on the album.
1922	The original title to "Deep in the Motherlode" was "Heavy". Rutherford uses a bottleneck slide guitar which he was inexperienced with at first to the point of placing it "on the wrong hand". "Many Too Many" features more lead guitar work from Rutherford, who felt less confident about his playing compared to the months after the album's release and had practised further. Once the basic tracks had been put down, the group were still unsure on how to finish the song and sought more arrangements to complete it, including a string sound Banks played on a Moog synthesiser. At one point, they considered using orchestral instruments for the track but they never tried it. Banks, who penned the song's lyrics, recalled an issue Collins had with singing the word "mama" in the chorus, something which Banks had to reassure him that he could sing it. "Scenes from a Night's Dream" is based on a childhood dream, itself inspired by the cartoon strip character Little Nemo which Collins had bought a book on for his brother. The song developed from a musical idea from Banks who wrote the first draft of its lyrics, but he gave up halfway through as he felt they were unsuitable. The band instead settled on a set of lyrics that Collins offered during down time while mixing at Trident Studios that brought in a different melody and more harmonies.
1923	"Say It's Alright Joe", written by Rutherford and the penultimate track recorded for the album, is a torch song about an alcoholic who goes into a drunken stupor. The guitarist intended the track to be a "piss-take on the Dean Martin 'set 'em up Joe' alcoholic style'", but thought it was not going to work until Banks added his keyboard overdubs and the band started mixing the track, at which point it "came to life". The introduction to "The Lady Lies" was meant to have a "strippers feel to it. Hence the title". Genesis deliberately planned to close the album on a "lighter note" as a contrast to a heavier track, so they placed "Follow You Follow Me" at the end, the album's only track written during the rehearsal stage and went through numerous guises before the group settled on a three-minute song. Hentschel was dismissive of the song, but prepared an initial mix and presented it to the staff at Atlantic Records, who recognised it as a potential hit single for the band. The song was remixed and included on the album. The lyrics were written by Rutherford and were inspired by his wife. He later said it was the easiest set of lyrics he had written, spending "about ten minutes" on it.
1924	...And Then There Were Three... was released in the UK on 31 March 1978 and in the US on 28 March on Atlantic Records. It reached No.  3 on the UK Albums Chart during a 32-week stay on the chart and No.  14 on the US Billboard 200. The album continued to sell, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on 31 May 1978 for 500,000 copies sold in the US. It reached platinum status on 11 February 1988 for selling one million copies. The album was considered a commercial breakthrough for Genesis, as it brought in sufficiently large audiences to be able to make a profit from touring, which before then had always run at a loss.
1925	A digitally remastered version was released on CD in 1994 on Virgin in Europe and Atlantic in the US and Canada. A SACD / DVD double disc set (including new 5.1 and Stereo mixes) was released on 2 April 2007. It was released in the US and Canada as part of the Genesis 1976–1982 box set. This includes the album in remixed stereo and surround sound, and related video tracks. The only exception is the track "Say It's Alright Joe", which was not remixed because the band was unable to locate the multitrack recordings.
1926	In an April 1978 review for Melody Maker, reporter Chris Welch praised the album as "strong, confident" that is "as good as any they have made in the band's post-Gabriel years". Welch noted the songs have "a sense of purpose" and come with "a remarkably powerful sound", and picked "Ballad of Big" as his favourite track. A review in The Town Talk praised the group for filling the gap Hackett left "confidently" and picks "Down and Out" as claim of their survival. The rest of the album is "a tapestry of imaginary landscapes filled with the struggling mythic heroes that Genesis has learned to depict so well". Gary Mullinax for The Morning News thought the album sounded little different to Wind & Wuthering and noted the dominance of Banks's keyboards over Rutherford's guitars, with "the same dreamy wall-of-sound music with the same high-pitched vocals" from Collins. He concluded that Genesis succeed at points on the album but thought many songs on it fail to go anywhere, "blending into one another like some sort of hip musak". Charley Walters, writing in Circus, said that despite the exits of Gabriel and Hackett, Genesis have sacrificed "neither direction nor quality". The album, he thought, has "hard, almost ominous" tracks like "Down and Out" and "softer, more melodic" ones like "Say It's Alright Joe", all of which create "a magical, mystical sound that sets them apart from the numerous similar but usually inferior European art-rock ensembles". He names Banks as the one of the trio most responsible for their sound with his "rich" arrangements complemented by Rutherford's restrained guitar work which is "more felt than heard" which worked well to his praise on "Burning Rope". Walters, however, thought Collins's vocals has shortcomings that lacks expansion or breathtaking moments, though is a drummer who can still be melodic.
1927	Other reviewers were more critical of the album, including Jon Pareles and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau, who said that "without lead guitarist Steve Hackett, the band loses its last remaining focal point; the rest is double-tracking. Hence a sound as mushy as the dread Moody Blues, with fewer excuses." In Crawdaddy, Michael Bloom found Banks's sounding arrangements and keyboard sounds poor, saying they tend to "practically vanish" and "slip through your fingers". He also declared Rutherford's lead guitar playing as "unbearably clumsy" compared to Hackett but remains a "rare bassist" whose 12-string guitar playing reminded the reviewer of Rutherford on Trespass (1970) and the surrounding period in the band's history. Bloom picked out "The Lady Lies" as Banks's strongest contribution both musically and lyrically, comparing the composition and lyrical message to "One for the Vine" on Wind & Wuthering, and also highlighted "Deep in the Motherlode" as a strong track, but found Collins's singing "uniformly insipid" and concluded that the album is "less of a disappointment than an interminable frustration". In his review for Rolling Stone, he said Hackett's "wonderful orchestral guitar playing, which once governed his subtle use of effects, has unfortunately evaporated in the baldness of his new material", while concluding that "this contemptible opus is but the palest shadow of the group's earlier accomplishments."
1928	The group needed an additional touring member to cover all the material, but Rutherford only wanted to play lead guitar on the new songs from ...And Then There Were Three... and return to bass and twelve-string for everything else. The successful applicant would have to play bass on the new material and cover Hackett's old lead parts. They first approached Weather Report's Alphonso Johnson, but he was primarily a bassist and his style did not fit in with the rest of the band. Johnson suggested instead that they consider jazz-fusion guitarist Daryl Stuermer, who was already a Genesis fan. He tried out an audition in New York, playing bass on "Down and Out" and lead guitar on "Squonk" (from A Trick of the Tail) and was immediately hired.
1929	"The Fountain of Salmacis", the closing track from 1971's Nursery Cryme was reintroduced into the live set, so Stuermer could take a song with a distinctive Hackett solo and put his own stamp on it. "Say It's Alright Joe" was performed with Collins in character wearing a raincoat and using Banks' keyboards as a makeshift bar. The tour had several breaks so the band could have time with their family at home. Collins later said the tour was "an end of an era" and thought the group did not need to play live as much in the future.
1930	In July 2012, Questlove said on his Twitter account that the title of The Roots' next album would have the initials &TYSYC and that it was being recorded, with a different sound to expect than from Undun. In the November 12, 2012 issue of The New Yorker, Questlove revealed that the album is tentatively named & Then You Shoot Your Cousin. In a June 2013 interview with Fuse TV, Questlove said he would prefer to release an album in the first quarter of the year, and that he also had other projects he was working on. In February 2014, in an interview with XXL, Black Thought said that the album would be a concept album in the spirit of Undun. He describes the work as a satire of hip-hop stereotypes featuring several different characters. On April 7, 2014, DJ Kast One premiered their first single from the album, "When the People Cheer", on Hot 97.
1931	...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on 26 reviews. Andy Kellman of AllMusic felt that it may be the most challenging album from The Roots because of its experimental elements and variety of guest vocalists. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone likened it to a hip hop version of Nine Inch Nail's 1994 album The Downward Spiral because of its downbeat, existential theme. Omar Burgess of HipHopDX said that although the music is occasionally discordant, it is also "depressingly good, which makes it a bit of a confusing product in a Hip Hop landscape bifurcated by Golden Era romanticists and the turnt-up set." Robert Christgau wrote in Cuepoint that it is more consistent musically than Undun and is "a touching, upsetting meditation in which a sketchy gangsta wannabe embodies the limits of all striving."
1932	Evan Rytlewski of The A.V. Club said, "With their 11th effort, The Roots have managed yet another album individualistic like little else in hip-hop, but unlike their best work this one’s more interested in scholastic provocation than genuine pathos." Jesse Cataldo of Slant Magazine said, "A depiction of disorder and chaos, ... the album's approach [integrates] neatly into an overall sense of claustrophobic dread." Reed Jackson of XXL said, "The Roots have not only proven once again that they are one of hip-hop’s most consistent acts, but also one of the genre’s most important." Hilary Saunders of Paste said, "The Roots prove their mastery of mixing high and low culture for diverse audiences. It’s a headier album, but one rife with significance."
1933	...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead (often abbreviated as Trail of Dead, or T.o.D., which reads as "death" in German) are an American alternative rock band from Austin, Texas, formed in 1994. The chief members of the band are Jason Reece and Conrad Keely (formerly Conrad Sobsamai). The two alternate between drumming, guitar and lead vocals, both on recordings and live shows. The band is known for their wild, energetic concerts. Their tenth studio album, X: The Godless Void and Other Stories, was released on January 17, 2020.
1934	Keely and Reece have been friends since their youth, and originally in Hawaii. They each formed their first bands in Olympia, Washington, where Keely studied at The Evergreen State College. Keely, a songwriter and bassist named James Olsen and a guitarist (Paul Westmoreland) started a band in the early 1990s. The band was called varied things before settling on "Benedict Gehlen" (named after a monk laid to rest in the St. Martin's Abby in Olympia). That went on in various names and forms until 1993. Soon after, Keely became involved in a group called Nancyville, while Reece went on to play drums with Honeybucket and then queercore band Mukilteo Fairies (the name is a play on words, referencing the ferry boat that travels between Mukilteo and Clinton, Washington). Eventually, Keely and Reece moved to Austin, Texas. The two started playing as a duo under the moniker "You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead." The band expanded eventually to include guitarist Kevin Allen and bassist Neil Busch. They then officially lengthened their name to ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead. Keely's girlfriend from Olympia, Deanne Rowley (later Deanne McAdams), briefly played with them as a live back-up guitarist.
1935	In July 2004, it was announced that Neil Busch had been removed from the band and Danny Wood would be taking his place on bass. Second drummer/percussionist Doni Schroader also joined the band around this time. Trail of Dead released Worlds Apart on January 25, 2005. Music videos were filmed for singles "And the Rest Will Follow" and "Caterwaul". The band also added live keyboardist David Longoria to their touring lineup. Now a six-piece, the band toured heavily on the album, with its trademark explosive live performances and a two-drummer attack. Opening for part of this tour was Longoria's band The Black, which featured Longoria on vocals and guitarist Alan Schaefer, with the rest of TOD filling out the group. The band's fifth album, So Divided, was released on November 14, 2006. Clay Morris replaced Longoria as live keyboardist, and eventually became a full-time member.
1936	In late summer of 2007, Trail of Dead once again toured Europe, this time with drummer Aaron Ford replacing Doni Schroader. Danny Wood was absent from these performances, having quietly left the band. He would eventually be replaced by Jay Leo Phillips. The band provided the soundtrack to the 2007 film Hell on Wheels, a documentary about the formation of Roller Derby in Austin, Texas. After their overseas tour ended on March 15, 2007, Trail of Dead returned to the studio to begin recording their sixth record. In October, they supported the virtual band Dethklok on an Adult Swim college tour. In that same month, the band became independent after leaving Interscope Records due to a lack of support.
1937	In early 2008, Trail of Dead went back into the studio without a record contract. Using their own capital, they filmed their recording experiences and released them on YouTube. On October 21, they released an EP, resembling an "album teaser", titled Festival Thyme on Richter Scale Records. On February 17, 2009, a 13-track album, The Century of Self was released. In September 2010, Keely posted news of an upcoming album 2011 release, produced by Chris "Frenchie" Smith, with an accompanying comic book. Smith is also set to re-mix their debut eponymous album. On November 10, 2010, the band announced that their seventh album, Tao of the Dead, would be released in North America on February 8, 2011. It was also revealed that the band had stripped down to a core four-piece, and that Jay Phillips, Clay Morris and longtime guitarist Kevin Allen had been removed from the lineup. Circumstances of these departures are currently unknown. Aaron Ford recorded all of the drums for Tao of the Dead, but then left the band. The band performed live on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on February 7, 2011, debuting bassist Autry Fulbright II (from Reece side project Midnight Masses) and drummer/guitarist Jamie Miller, of the band theSTART. On February 17, 2011, it was announced that Reece would guest host Toby Ryan's radio show on Austin's KROX-FM (101X).
1938	In May 2013, the band announced a forthcoming EP Tao of the Dead Part III via Twitter. Using PledgeMusic, they were taking pre-orders for special editions of the EP. In February 2014, the band announced a limited U.S. tour focused on playing music from Source Tags and Codes and plans to record their next album, a sequel to Tao of the Dead, in the spring and summer of 2014. In April 2014, they released the album Live at Rockpalast 2009. In August 2014, the band announced their ninth album, IX, using an online jigsaw puzzle. Pitchfork suggested "the arrival at a crossroads" for the band with the album. After a subsequent tour the band, Keely moved to Cambodia and released his debut solo album, Original Machines, in 2016. In November 2017, the band announced a European tour to celebrate the 20 year anniversary of the release of their debut album, Madonna, performing the album in full.
1939	...And a Happy New Year is a Christmas EP by the band The Maine. On December 4, 2008, the EP was announce for release. The EP was free for those that pre-ordered the deluxe edition of the band's debut album, Can't Stop Won't Stop. In addition, "Santa Stole My Girlfriend" was made available for streaming on the group's PureVolume account, while "Ho Ho Hopefully" was made available for streaming through the band's Myspace profile. The EP was made available for streaming on December 7 and was released on December 9 by Fearless Records.
1940	...And a Time to Dance is a 1983 EP by Los Lobos. It was co-produced by T-Bone Burnett and Steve Berlin (not yet a full-time member of the band) and was the band's first release on Slash Records. The EP brought the band its first wide acclaim. It was voted best EP of the year in the Village Voice's influential Pazz & Jop critics poll. Critic Robert Christgau gave the record an "A-" in his Consumer Guide, calling it "good old rock and roll East L.A. style." Trouser Press raved about "a spicy romp (in two languages) back and forth across musical borders few can traverse with such ease," while Rolling Stone called it "an infectious dance record that deserves to be heard by rock fans."
1941	Walt and Jesse clean up the bloody remains of Emilio while Krazy-8 regains consciousness in the basement. While talking with Walt, Krazy-8 reveals that Jesse told him and Emilio about Walt's personal life. Walt then confronts Jesse, in the middle of getting high off meth, who berates him for not living up to his end of the bargain on the two and drives off. Meanwhile, Skyler tells Marie that she is working on a new short story with a stoner character in it, and she asks her about marijuana. Marie assumes that Skyler thinks Walt Jr. is smoking pot, but Skyler insists that she was just talking about her story. Marie asks Hank to scare Walt Jr. straight, leading him to bring Walt Jr. to a motel to show how meth has corroded the teeth of a prostitute.
1942	Walt phones Skyler to apologize for being late, falsely claiming that he's working over at the car wash. Skyler informs Walt that she knows he quit his job there two weeks previously and angrily tells him to not come home. Walt weighs the pros and cons of killing Krazy-8, then collapses on the basement floor while bringing him a sandwich, shattering the plate. After he regains consciousness, Walt tells Krazy-8 he has lung cancer. After engaging in conversation with Krazy-8 and seemingly forming a bond with him, Walt decides to let him go free. Walt goes to get the key to the bike lock which is holding Krazy-8 captive. However, he realizes that there is a large shard missing from the broken plate, indicating that Krazy-8 obtained it while he was unconscious and plans to use it as a weapon. Walt reluctantly garrotes Krazy-8 with the bike lock while he stabs backward into Walt's leg with the broken plate. Walt goes back home to find Skyler sitting on the bed, crying. He says he has something to tell her.
1943	The episode received critical acclaim. Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.9 out of 10 commenting: "If you put every episode of every TV show in existence and rolled it up into one giant ball, we doubt you'd come out with anything as intense as that one minute of television where Walt killed Crazy-8." Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode an "A-", saying: "All the heavy stuff I loved so much and described above -- yet this was also an episode full of hilarious lines."
1944	...And the Circus Leaves Town is the fourth and final studio album by American stoner rock band Kyuss, released on July 11, 1995, nearly a year before their breakup. Drummer Alfredo Hernández (Yawning Man) replaces Brant Bjork, who left Kyuss in 1993. The album features a tighter and more straightforward sound, both in songwriting and production, than the band's preceding efforts. The album was not as commercially or critically successful as the previous Blues for the Red Sun and Welcome to Sky Valley. Critic Dean Brown attributes this partly to a lack of promotion and the band's breakup, but also notes that the album "deserves to be cherished as much as the two molten hot records that came right before it." A video was released for "One Inch Man", the album's only official single.
1945	...And the Native Hipsters was a London-based duo of musicians William Wilding from Romford England, and Blatt (Nanette Greenblatt) from Cape Town, South Africa. They had previously worked together as the Wildings, and then the Patterns with Robert Cubitt and Tom Fawcett. The Patterns became the Native Hipsters in 1979 when they recorded "There Goes Concorde Again", a 6:45 minute song featuring Blatt repeating with "childlike enthusiasm" the refrain "Ooh, look, there goes Concorde again", with reference to sightings of the famed "silverbird". AllMusic described the song as a "formless composition" with "perfectly-devoid-of-skill vocals, a wobbly funhouse synth, the occasional guitar pling, and not much bass".
1946	"There Goes Concorde Again" was a home recording that was privately released by the group as a single in a limited edition of 500 copies. Each disc had its label hand-stamped by the group, and the sleeves were cut from advertising posters (including one of Kevin Keegan, an English footballer), making each cover virtually unique. They sent the records to Rough Trade, an independent record shop in London, and about a month later BBC Radio 1 DJ John Peel picked up a copy and began playing the song extensively on his radio program. Soon the group had an order for another 1,000 copies, and then a further 4,000. The song entered the UK Independent Charts in August 1980, where it remained for ten weeks, peaking at number five. Wilding received an offer from producer Tony Visconti to re-record the song, but turned it down for fear of it becoming "too commercial". The song was later listed by New Musical Express in their "NME Writers 100 Best Indie Singles Ever" in 1992.
1947	In 1982 the Native Hipsters released a four-track EP, "Tenderly Hurt Me" which was well received by the music press. Over the next few years the group performed live several times, including opening for Bauhaus, and recorded a number of songs with the help of various musicians, including guitarist Lester Square from The Monochrome Set, and Annie Whitehead, a session trombonist. By the mid-1980s the group had stopped recording, but interest in them was revived in 2001 when Rough Trade included "There Goes Concorde Again" in a box set, Rough Trade Shops – 25 Years. This prompted Wilding to release two CDs, There Goes Concorde Again... (2001) and Songs to Protest About (2006) containing their singles, previously unreleased songs and new material. Interest in the Native Hipsters was renewed again in 2009 when a compilation set, Kats Karavan: The History of John Peel on the Radio included "There Goes Concorde Again". Rock music critic Peter Paphides said in a review of the album that ...And the Native Hipsters was one of the artists always associated with John Peel.
1948	The founding members of ...And the Saga Continues were Jonah Aspler on bass, Truffle Simmons on guitar, Matt "The Fridge" Dillitzer on drums, and Chris Ross on vocals. Aspler and Simmons had previously played together in late 90s seminal Quebec punk band All the Answers, alongside other musicians Chris Snelgrove and Mike Sokolyk. Simmons eventually left All the Answers to begin another band, One Step Away, with Dillitzer and Ross. When Aspler later joined One Step Away, the band changed its name to ...And the Saga Continues, shifting its approach to a faster and more aggressive hardcore sound.
1949	Since the band's discontinuation, its members have continued to be active. In 2008, Simmons joined hardcore punk band Hold a Grudge (Insurgence Records) as its bass player. In 2009, Simmons and Dillitzer formed another hardcore band called The Forum. Aspler has played in a number of bands including, starting in 2012, Fredericton, NB's Hard Charger. As part of a 2015 tour, Aspler performed with both Jon Creeden & The Flying Hellfish, and with Chris Snelgrove and the Last Mile. Aspler currently plays with the band Conditions Apply, and with Psychic Raccoon whose song Smokey Mountain was recently included on a compilation album put out by Cuchabata Records who will be releasing the band's forthcoming album.
1950	...And the Women Who Love Them is an EP by the Berkeley, California punk rock band The Mr. T Experience, released in 1994 by Lookout! Records. It was the band's first release with drummer Jim "Jym" Pittman, replacing founding member Alex Laipeneiks who had left the group the previous year. It was recorded at a time when the band were very near breaking up permanently, and its release helped to creatively rejuvenate the group. Shortly after its release bassist Aaron Rubin left the band and was placed by Joel Reader.
1951	Some advance publicity for the album reported its title as ...at the Moment of our Most Needing or If Only They Could Turn Around, They Would Know They Weren't Alone, but its actual title upon release was just ...at the moment of our most needing. Frontman Chris Eaton told the music magazine Magnet in March 2009 that he had not yet decided between two distinct titles, either ...at the moment of our most needing or If Only They Could Turn Around, They Would Know They Weren't Alone, but other advance coverage of the album incorrectly reported that as a single title rather than a pending choice between two shorter ones.
1952	Geetha, the daughter of a millionaire, falls in love with Chandranath, a writer. Both have sex before marriage and they get married against the wishes of Geetha's father. Sadanandh, a rich publisher who lusts for Geetha, makes Chandranath rich. Chandranath takes to drinking, induces Geetha to drink and a drunk Sadanandh has sex with her; she is traumatised the next morning on learning of what happened. Later when Sadanandh tries to rape Geetha, he is shot dead by an unseen man. Geetha is tried and falsely accepts responsibility, but Chandranath claims responsibility to save her. Soon after, Chandranath's friend Prakash arrives and reveals himself as the real killer. Despite being exonerated, Geetha later commits suicide to purge herself of all she has been through.
1953	...Baby One More Time is the debut studio album by American singer Britney Spears. It was released on January 12, 1999, through Jive Records. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with her manager at the time, Lou Pearlman, to join female pop group Innosense, her mother, Lynne Spears, asked a family friend and entertainment lawyer, Larry Rudolph, for his opinion. Rudolph took interest and decided to pitch her to record labels. Rudolph submitted a tape of Britney Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song, along with a demo tape of an unused song from Toni Braxton. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.
1954	Spears traveled to Sweden to work with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop, and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin presented a track titled "Hit Me Baby (One More Time)" to Spears and her management, which had been rejected by the girl group TLC. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. Her debut album was completed in June 1998, and the song was released as "...Baby One More Time" as Spears' debut single in October. The single became a global success, reaching number one in every country it charted in, became the best-selling song of 1999 in the UK, and has since become one of the best-selling singles of all-time, selling over 10 million copies.
1955	At the time of its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics, with many labeling it silly and premature. Retrospectively, it has been hailed for its impact on pop culture and young female entertainment. ...Baby One More Time was a massive commercial success, debuting atop the Billboard 200 chart and Canadian Albums Chart, and reached the top 5 in several countries. It received worldwide certifications, including a 14× platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for shipments of over 14 million copies in the US, of which Nielsen SoundScan recognizes 10.7 million copies sold. ...Baby One More Time is Spears' most successful album with sales of over 25 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all-time.
1956	In June 1997, Spears was in talks with then-manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson or another Tiffany." Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated, "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that." They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney."
1957	Spears recorded thirteen songs with Eric Foster White, including "Autumn Goodbye", "E-Mail My Heart", "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart", "I'm So Curious", "I Will Still Love You", "Luv The Hurt Away", "Let Me Take You There", "Soda Pop", "Thinkin' About You", "Nothing Less Than Real", "Wishing on a Falling Star" and "You Got It All". The singer also recorded a cover of Sonny & Cher's 1967 single "The Beat Goes On". White was responsible for the vocal recording and song production, while additional production was done by English electronic music group All Seeing I.
1958	After hearing the material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from May 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop and Rami Yacoub, among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American R&B group TLC; however, they rejected it. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit. "We at Jive said, 'This is a fuckin' smash'," revealed the label's A&R executive, Steven Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line "Hit Me" would condone domestic violence, and later revised it to "...Baby One More Time". The singer revealed that she "didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '... Baby One More Time'." By June 1998, the album was done, and Spears embarked on a promotional tour sponsored by L'Oréal. ...Baby One More Time was initially set to release in October 1998 but due to marketing issues, it was pushed back to January 12, 1999.
1959	Spears originally envisioned "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary", but felt alright with her label's producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me." The album opens with the first single "...Baby One More Time", a teen pop and dance-pop song that begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as "We Will Rock You" (1977), "Start Me Up" (1981), "These Words" (2004) and the theme song of the film Jaws due to the fact the track "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, "...Baby One More Time" is composed by "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps". Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), observed that the lyrics of the song "gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." The next song and third single, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" runs through a moderately slow dance beat, and has a rhythm and blues melody mixed with edgy synthesized instrumentals. The third track and second single "Sometimes" is a ballad, that Spears begins with "You tell me you're in love with me/That you can't take your pretty eyes away from me/It's not that I don't wanna stay/But every time you come too close I move away". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted the song has "a catchy hook and endearing melody, with a reminiscent euro-dance rhythm."
1960	After "Sometimes" is ...Baby One More Time's fourth track, "Soda Pop", a song that draws influences from bubblegum pop and dancehall, and features background vocals from co-writer Mikey Bassie. Spears' vocals on the fifth track, "Born to Make You Happy" (which was released as the album's fourth single in Europe), span more than an octave. Its lyrics allude to a relationship that a woman desires to repair, not quite understanding what went wrong, as she comes to realize that "I don't know how to live without your love/I was born to make you happy". The sixth track and final single, "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart", is a sentimental slow-tempo teen pop ballad. "I Will Be There" is a pop rock song that features a guitar riff similar to Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn" (1997), with a "rousing chorus about standing by your man (or a best friend or a house pet)", as noted by Kyle Anderson of MTV. The eleventh track, "E-Mail My Heart", is a sensitive piano ballad where Spears sings, "E-mail me back/ And say our love will stay alive". The cover of Sonny & Cher's 1967 single "The Beat Goes On" is influenced by bossa nova and trip hop, and features a similar sound to spy movies themes. Among the bonus tracks included on some editions of the album is a cover of J'Son's 1996 song "I'll Never Stop Loving You".
1961	...Baby One More Time was released in North America and Philippines on January 12, 1999, in Japan on February 24 and in Europe and Oceania on March 8. The album was re-released in Europe on June 30, 2003, and the digital deluxe edition was released on December 25, 2007 (Christmas Day) in the United States. On August 14, 2017, it was announced that 2,500 pink and white swirled copies of ...Baby One More Time would be released on vinyl exclusively through Urban Outfitters on November 3, 2017; the vinyl was made available for pre-order that day.
1962	Promotion began in 1998, when Spears did a small tour in malls and food courts that were located mostly in larger cities around the United States and Canada. Each show lasted around thirty minutes, and Spears had two male dancers with her on the stage. The promo tour is also known as the L'Oréal Mall Tour, after its sponsor. The singer made several promotional appearances including talk shows and live performances around the world. In December 1998, Spears' first showed up on MTV's and the Box's most-requested video charts. She also appeared on the Ricki Lake Show, the Howie Mandel Show, and was the presenter of the 1999 American Music Awards, prior to the release of the album. The singer also appeared on MTV's Spring Break and on the hundredth episode of Nickelodeon's All That. However, after hurting her knee, she had rescheduled appearances several shows such as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. After recovering, Spears embarked on another promotional schedule. The singer appeared on Nickelodeon's 12th Annual Kids' Choice Awards on May 1, MTV's FANatic on May 12, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee on May 3, and The Rosie O'Donnell Show on May 25.
1963	Outside the United States, Spears visited German talk show Wetten, dass..? and Top of the Pops on June 25, 1999. She also went to the United Kingdom, making appearances on programmes such as This Morning, CD:UK and National Lottery. She visited a music variety show called Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ in Japan, and performed at the Festival Bar in Italy. Spears was also featured on an episode of ABC television sitcom, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, where she played herself. Spears was returning a favor to actress Melissa Joan Hart, who played a cameo role in Spears' video for "(You Drive Me) Crazy," according to People. The episode aired on September 24, 1999. The same month, Spears performed on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on September 27, and visited Carson Daly on MTV's Total Request Live the following day. She had a mini-Disney concert titled "Britney Spears & Joey McIntyre in Concert." Spears and Joey McIntyre performed live in the taped concert event. In November, Spears performed the album's first two singles at the MTV Europe Music Awards. Promotion for the album continued in early 2000, where Spears performed at the 2000 American Music Awards, and also performed "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" in a medley with "...Baby One More Time" at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards.
1964	On March 5, 1999, it was reported that Spears was planning her first headlining tour. She announced that the tour would start in July. On May 12, Tommy Hilfiger was announced as the main tour sponsor. During the time of the announcement, Spears was being featured in the company's "AllStars" campaign. On December 17, during the premiere of the music video of "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" on TRL, Spears called the show to announce March 2000 United States tour dates. The extension, entitled Crazy 2k Tour, was considered a prelude to her future world tour, Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour. The leg's main sponsor was Got Milk?. Media director Peter Gardiner explained, "Britney is magic with teen-age girls, and that's an absolutely crucial target for milk". Spears shot an advertising campaign to be shown before her performances began. The secondary sponsor was Polaroid and the corporation released the I-Zone as the tour's official camera. Spears used the I-Zone onstage to take pictures of the audience and further promote the product. The show was divided into segments, separated by interlude, ending with an encore. The set list consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers. Some changes were made during the 2000 leg, with the covers replaced by songs from her second studio album, Oops!... I Did It Again. The tour received positive critical appreciation. During the tour, Spears was accused of lip synching, although she denied these claims. On April 20, 2000, the concert at Hilton Hawaiian Village in Honolulu, Hawaii, was taped. It was slightly altered from its Crazy 2k incarnation and featured different costumes. On June 5, 2000, it was broadcast on Fox. The special was aired several times during the year. On November 21, 2000, JIVE Records released the Live and More! DVD, which included the Fox special. It was certified triple Platinum by the RIAA for shipping 300,000 units.
1965	"...Baby One More Time" was released as Spears' debut single on October 23, 1998. The song received generally favorable critical reviews, mostly praising its composition. "...Baby One More Time" attained worldwide success, reaching number one in every European country where it charted. It received numerous certifications around the world, and is one of the best-selling singles of all time, at over ten million copies. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, portrays Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to daydream that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. In 2010, the music video for "...Baby One More Time" was voted the third-most influential video in the history of pop music.
1966	"Sometimes" was released as the second single on April 30, 1999. "Sometimes" achieved commercial success worldwide, reaching number one on Ultratop Flanders Singles in Belgium, Mega Single Top 100 in Netherlands and RIANZ Singles in New Zealand, while peaking inside the top five in four countries. In the United States, "Sometimes" missed the top-twenty, peaking at number twenty-one on the Billboard Hot 100. The music video for the song was directed by Nigel Dick. During rehearsals, on February 11, 1999, Spears injured her left knee and needed surgery. After recuperating in Kentwood, Louisiana, the music video was shot on April 9–10, 1999 at Paradise Cove in Malibu, California.It was released on May 6, 1999, on MTV's Total Request Live.
1967	In May 1999, Max Martin and Spears went to the Battery Studios in New York City to re-record the vocals of "(You Drive Me) Crazy", for a reproduced version called "The Stop! Remix" that was going to be included on the original motion picture soundtrack of the film Drive Me Crazy (1999). "The Stop! Remix" of the song was released as the album's third single on August 23, 1999. The remix has the addition of a stanza where Spears yells "Stop!", then all sound cutting out, followed by a transition. It also omits the lines "Lovin' you mean so much more, more than anything I ever loved before". The music video was directed by Nigel Dick, and featured actors Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier.
1968	"From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" was released on December 15, 1999, as the final single. The song also received mixed reviews, finding the song a classic hit and competent single, despite considering it as an unremarkable song that refers only to kissing. "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" achieved moderate success, peaking at number thirty-seven in Australia, and twenty-three in New Zealand. Through imports, the song reached one hundred seventy-four in the United Kingdom. In the United States, "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" reached number fourteen on Billboard Hot 100, and seventeen on Pop Songs, and was later certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on March 28, 2000, for selling over 1,000,000 physical units of the single. The music video, directed by Gregory Dark, was released on December 17, 1999. It was highly criticized due to the fact that Dark had previously directed porn films.
1969	Kyle Anderson of MTV said he "was surprised in more ways than one" with his first listening of ...Baby One More Time, commenting he "expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being. There has never been any mystery to why Spears became such a superstar, but these songs probably would have been huge even if Britney wore burlap sacks in all of her videos." Barry Walters of Rolling Stone gave the album two stars out of five, and compared the album's sound to early hits of Debbie Gibson, Mariah Carey, and Samantha Fox. Walters also said that "while several Cherion-crafted kiddie-funk jams serve up beefy hooks, shameless schlock slowies, like 'E-Mail My Heart', is pure spam." A NME reviewer rated ...Baby One More Time 1 out of 10, saying that "we seem to have reached crisis point: pubescent pop is now so rife that 17-year-old Britney 'lizard-lounge' Spears is already halfway through her lucrative showbiz career". He also found the album premature, commenting, "hopefully, if she starts to live the wretched life that we all eventually do, her voice will show the scars, she'll stop looking so fucking smug, she'll find solace in drugs and we'll be all the happier for it. Now grow up, girl. Quick!" Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic felt that, "with the exception of the terrific title track, ...Baby One More Time is a collection of either competent pop songs underwhelmingly executed or underwhelmingly written pop songs competently executed." The album has listed as the 16th best female album of all time on Billboard 200.
1970	...Baby One More Time debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 selling 121,000 copies in its first week, replacing DMX's Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood (1998). Spears broke several records by doing so. The singer became the first new female artist to have a number one single on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one album on the Billboard 200 at the same time; the first new artist (male or female) to have a single go to the number one spot the same week that the album debuted at number one; and the first new female artist to have the first single and first album at number one the same week. Spears is also the youngest female in Billboard history to have a simultaneous single and album at number one in the same week. After four weeks since its release, the album had sold more than 500,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan sales data. After dropping to the top five, the album went back to number one in its fourth week. On its fifth week it reached its highest sales week with 229,000 copies sold, and a total of over 804,000 copies sold. ...Baby One More Time spent a total of six non-consecutive weeks at number one, and sold more than 1.8 million copies in its first two months of release in the country. In its forty-seventh week on the Billboard 200, the album held strong at number three, and with sales of over of 10 million copies in the United States alone. The album was later certified diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), making Spears the youngest artist to receive that award, breaking Alanis Morissette's record, who was 21 years old when she released Jagged Little Pill (1995). The album was the 14th album since 1991 to sell over 10 million copies in the United States, and Spears became the best-selling female artist of 1999. ...Baby One More Time spent a total of 51 weeks in the top 10 of the Billboard 200. It was the second best-selling album in the US, only behind Millennium by the Backstreet Boys. The album spent a total of one-hundred-and-three weeks on the chart. ...Baby One More Time landed at number three on BMG Music Club all-time best-sellers list, selling 1.6 million units, behind Shania Twain's Come on Over (1997).
1971	The album debuted at number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, totaling nine non-consecutive weeks at the top. On December 12, 1999, the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) certified it diamond, for sales over one million units. ...Baby One More Time spent two weeks at number two on the European Top 100 Albums, and sold over four million copies within the continent, being certified quadruple platinum by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI). The album reached number two on the UK Albums Chart, number four on French Albums Chart and was certified quadruple platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), double platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique (SNEP), triple gold in Germany by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), and decuple platinum (diamond) by the Polish Society of the Phonographic Industry (ZPAV). ...Baby One More Time debuted at number nine in May 1999 on the ARIA Albums Chart in Australia, reaching number two nine weeks later, placing behind the Dawson's Creek soundtrack. The album became the seventh highest-selling of 1999 in the country, and was certified quadruple platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) the following year after shipping 280,000 copies to retailers. The album debuted at number three on the RIANZ Albums Chart in New Zealand, placing behind Shania Twain's Come on Over (1997) and The Corrs' Talk on Corners (1997). The album was later certified triple platinum in the country by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ). ...Baby One More Time was the best-selling female album of 1999 selling 17 million copies by the end of 1999.
1972	Spears was credited with leading the revival of teen pop. The Daily Yomiuri reported that "critics have hailed her as the most gifted teenage pop idol for many years, but Spears has set her sights a little higher-she is aiming for the level of superstardom that has been achieved by Madonna and Janet Jackson." Rolling Stone wrote: "Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene." Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin commented, "I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice." Chuck Taylor of Billboard observed, "Spears has become a consummate performer, with snappy dance moves, a clearly real-albeit young-and funkdified voice ... "(You Drive Me) Crazy", her third single ... demonstrates Spears' own development, proving that the 17-year-old is finding her own vocal personality after so many months of steadfast practice." Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic referred to her music as a "blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry." Sputnikmusic writer Amanda Murray noted the album "offers a marker for Spears' progression as an artist, as a celebrity, and as a woman." In 2010, the album was included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.
1973	Spears became an international pop culture icon immediately after launching her recording career. Rolling Stone magazine wrote: "One of the most controversial and successful female vocalists of the 21st century," she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that broke the bank". She is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the "Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist". Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, "She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears sold more than 25 million albums worldwide". Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry". ...Baby One More Time is Spears' most successful album to date, with worldwide sales of 27 million copies, and also the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.
1974	"...Baby One More Time" was released on September 28, 1998, by Jive Records. It became a worldwide hit, topping the charts in at least 22 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it earned triple-platinum certification from the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and was the country's best-selling single of 1999. The song is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over ten million copies sold. An accompanying music video, directed by Nigel Dick, features Spears as a student from a Catholic high school, who starts to daydream that she is singing and dancing around the school, while watching her love interest from afar. The music video was later referenced in the music video of "If U Seek Amy" (2009), where Spears's fictional daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. In 2010, the music video for "...Baby One More Time" was voted the third most influential video in the history of pop music, in a poll held by Jam!. In 2011, "...Baby One More Time" was voted by Billboard to be the best music video of the 1990s. It has been featured on all of her greatest hits and other compilation albums. In 2020, Rolling Stone named "...Baby One More Time" as the greatest debut single of all time.
1975	Spears has performed "...Baby One More Time" in a number of live appearances and during all of her concert tours. It was the encore of the ...Baby One More Time Tour (1999) and Dream Within a Dream Tour (2001–02); Spears also performed remixed versions of the song during the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour (2000–01), The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), The M+M's Tour (2007), The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009), the Femme Fatale Tour (2011), and her concert residency Britney: Piece of Me (2013–17). "...Baby One More Time" was nominated for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance at the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards (2000), and has been included in lists by Blender, Rolling Stone and VH1. It has been noted for redefining the sound of late 1990s music. Spears has named "...Baby One More Time" as one of her favorite songs from her catalog. It was also the final song to be played on the BBC's music programme Top of the Pops in the 1990s. It is also featured in the 2011 dance video game by Ubisoft, Just Dance 3. In 2018, readers of German teen magazine Bravo voted "...Baby One More Time" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.
1976	In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne Spears asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a sound engineer. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and "there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany." Two weeks later, executives from JIVE Records returned calls to Rudolph. Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that "It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that." They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from "lower and less poppy" delivery to "distinctively, unmistakably Britney." After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned "Sheryl Crow music, but younger more adult contemporary" but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since "It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me."
1977	Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled "Hit Me Baby One More Time", which was originally written for American boy band, the Backstreet Boys and the R&B group TLC; however, when the song was submitted to them, they rejected it. The label thought the song would work for the English group Five, but they also passed on it. Spears later said that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. "We at JIVE said, 'This is a ... smash'," revealed the label's A&R executive at the time Stephen Lunt; however, other executives were concerned that the line "Hit Me" would condone domestic violence, later being revised to "...Baby One More Time".
1978	Spears recorded her vocals for the song in May 1998 at Cheiron Studios. She stayed up late the night before listening to Soft Cell's "Tainted Love" ("What a sexy song") to get the growl she wanted: "I wanted my voice to be kind of rusty." Spears revealed that she "didn't do well at all the first day in the studio [recording the song], I was just too nervous. So I went out that night and had some fun. The next day I was completely relaxed and nailed it. You gotta be relaxed singing '… Baby One More Time'." The song was produced by Denniz Pop, Martin and Rami, and was also mixed by Martin at Cheiron Studios. Thomas Lindberg played the guitar, while Johan Carlberg played the bass guitar. Background vocals were provided by Spears, Martin and Nana Hedin. Spears also recorded a track called "Autumn Goodbye", written and produced by Eric Foster White, that was released as a b-side to "...Baby One More Time". The track was recorded in 1998 at 4MW East Studios in New Jersey.
1979	"...Baby One More Time" was released as Spears's debut single on October 23, 1998, by Jive Records, when she was only sixteen years old. Spears has named "...Baby One More Time" as one of her favorite songs in her entire catalog, naming "Toxic" and "He About to Lose Me" as the other two. Like TLC and Backstreet Boys, British boy band Five were almost considered to record the song, according to their former manager Simon Cowell, who would work with Spears in the second season of the American version of The X Factor in 2012, in his autobiography Sweet Revenge.
1980	"...Baby One More Time" is a teen pop and dance-pop song that lasts for three minutes and thirty seconds. The song is composed in the key of C minor and is set in the time signature of 4/4 common time with a moderate tempo of 93 beats per minute. Songwriting and production is largely based on previous Cheiron productions, most notably Robyn's "Show Me Love", which shows similar song scheme, drum patterns, wah guitars and piano hits. Spears's vocal range spans over one octave from E♭3 to C5. The song begins with a three-note motif in the bass range of the piano, an opening that has been compared to many other songs, such as "We Will Rock You" (1977), "Start Me Up" (1981), "These Words" (2004) and the theme song of the 1975 film Jaws due to the fact the track "makes its presence known in exactly one second". According to magazine Blender, "...Baby One More Time" is composed by "wah-wah guitar lines and EKG-machine bass-slaps".
1981	Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, authors of Girl Culture: Studying girl culture: a readers' guide (2008), noted the lyrics of the song "gesture toward [Spears] longing for the return of an ex-boyfriend." Spears said "...Baby One More Time" is a song "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." The lyrics, however, caused controversy in the United States, because the line "Hit me baby one more time" supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line "doesn't mean physically hit me. [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant." Music journalist John Seabrook has said "Everybody thought it was some sort of weird allusion to domestic violence or something. But what it really was the Swedes using English incorrectly. What they really wanted to say was, 'hit me up on the phone one more time' or something. But at that point, Max's English wasn't that great. So it came out sounding a little bit weird in English."
1982	Marc Oxoby, author of The 1990s (2003), noted the song "was derided as vapid by some critics, yet tapped into the same kind of audience to whom the Spice Girls music appealed, young teens and pre-teens." Amanda Murray of Sputnikmusic commented, "[" ... Baby One More Time" is] well-composed, tightly arranged, and even with Spears's vocal limitations it goes straight for the proverbial pop jugular." She also said that the song was a highlight in the pop music genre and added, "There is little doubt that '...Baby One More Time' will be long remembered as one of the cornerstones of pop music in general, and it is a strong front-runner as the prototype for the late 90s pop resurgence." Bill Lamb of About.com considered "...Baby One More Time" as Spears's best song, saying, "the song is full of hooks and a big mainstream pop sound. The accompanying schoolgirl video caused a sensation, and, when the single hit No. 1, Britney was assured of stardom." In a list compiled by Sara Anderson of AOL Radio, "...Baby One More Time" was ranked sixth in a list of Spears's best songs. She noted the singer "somehow made the school girl outfit and pink pom-pom hair-ties trendy again, worn by every tween in the succeeding years."
1983	Larry Flick of Billboard wrote, "Produced by famed Euro-popsters Max Martin and Eric Foster, "Baby, One More Time" chugs with an insinuating faux-funk beat and super-shiny synths. Spears has a charming kewpie-doll voice that has a soulful quality that leaves the listener intrigued and wondering where she'll go with time and experience." Beth Johnson of Entertainment Weekly called it a "candy-pop-with-a-funky-edge smash", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said the song was "ingenious", Brian Raftery of Blender called it "a perfectly fine, slickly conceived pop tune. [..] At the time, teen-pop was still a boys' club, but while the guys were crooning about crushes, Spears was already planning the sleep-over party". In 2009, Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone called it "some of the best radio pop of the past decade-plus". NME considered "...Baby One More Time" "incredible", commenting that "it's a symphony of teenage lust as fully realised as anything Brian Wilson ever wrote – a truly grand pop song that overwhelms any lingering undercurrent of Lolita paedo-creepiness through the sheer fanatical earnestness of its delivery." "...Baby One More Time" won a Teen Choice Award for Single of the Year and an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Song.
1984	The song was officially sent to contemporary hit and rhythmic contemporary radio on September 28, 1998. On November 21, 1998, "...Baby One More Time" debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 at number 17 and topped the chart two and a half months later for two consecutive weeks, replacing R&B-singer Brandy's "Have You Ever?". Simultaneously, it climbed to number-one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The song reached the top spot of the Hot 100 Singles Sales and stayed there for four consecutive weeks. This eventually propelled the single to a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America. Though not as strong as its sales tallies, "...Baby One More Time" also experienced considerable airplay, becoming her first top ten hit on the Hot 100 Airplay, peaking at number eight. The single also became an all-around hit on Top 40 radio, going top ten on both the Top 40 Tracks and Rhythmic Top 40, and to number one for five weeks on the Mainstream Top 40. It spent 32 weeks on the Hot 100 and ended up at number five on Billboard magazine's year-end chart. As of June 2012, "...Baby One More Time" has sold 1,412,000 physical singles, with 511,000 paid digital downloads in the United States. It is Spears's best-selling physical single in the country. "...Baby One More Time" debuted at number 20 on the Australian Singles Chart, a month later reached number one and stayed there for nine consecutive weeks. The song eventually became the second highest-selling single of the year, only behind Lou Bega's "Mambo#5", and was certified three-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 210,000 copies. In New Zealand, the single spent four non-consecutive weeks at the top of the charts and after shipping over 15,000 units to retailers the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand certified it platinum.
1985	The track reached the top spot in every European country in which it charted. "...Baby One More Time" spent two consecutive weeks at number-one on the French Singles Chart and was certified platinum by the Syndicat National de l'Édition Phonographique after selling over 500,000 units in the country. Additionally, the song topped the German Singles Chart for six consecutive weeks and sold over 750,000 copies, resulting in a three-times gold certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. In the United Kingdom, according to Jive Records, "...Baby One More Time" sold more than 250,000 copies in a mere three days. Spears broke a first-week sales record for a female act in the UK at the time when "...Baby One More Time" sold a total of 460,000 copies. Eventually, the British Phonographic Industry certified it two-times platinum on March 26, 1999. The single went on to sell over 1,445,000 units by the end of 1999, making it the highest-selling single of that year and the 8th biggest song of the 1990s. As of 2018, it is the 32nd best-seller of all-time in the UK. Additionally, "...Baby One More Time" is the fifth best-selling single by a female artist in the country, behind Cher's "Believe", Whitney Houston's "I Will Always Love You", Adele's "Someone like You" and Céline Dion's "My Heart Will Go On". "...Baby One More Time" is one of the best-selling singles of all time, with over 10 million copies sold worldwide. As of May 2020, "...Baby One More Time" has generated over 285 million streams in the US.
1986	The music video was directed by Nigel Dick. After being chosen, Dick received criticism from his colleagues about wanting to work with Spears. He responded saying, "It's a great song. I don't know anything about Britney. I never watched The Mickey Mouse Club. She seems like a great kid and she's very enthusiastic, but I just love the song. It's just a great song". The video's original setup was in high contrast to what eventually became the final product. The plan was to have the video in a cartoon-like environment, in a likely attempt to attract the audience of younger children. Spears was unhappy with this, and argued that she wanted her video to reflect the lives of her fans and wanted to set the video in a school. Spears pitched this idea to Dick, and further explained she wanted the video to have dance scenes. The original setting was scrapped and replaced with Spears's concept. Dick's original idea for the wardrobe was jeans and a T-shirt, but during the wardrobe fitting Spears decided to change it for a schoolgirl outfit. Dick said that "Every piece of wardrobe in the video came from Kmart, and I was told at the time not one piece of clothing in the video cost more than $17. On that level, it's real. That probably, in retrospect, is a part of its charm." The knotted shirt design was Spears's idea, she recollects saying, "The outfits looked kind of dorky, so I was like, 'Let's tie up our shirts and be cute'". About the experience of shooting her first music video, Spears said, "It was a wonderful experience. All these people there, working for you. I had my own trailer. It was an amazing experience". The music video was shot on August 7 and 8, 1998, at Venice High School, the same school used to shoot the 1978 film Grease. The video premiered on MTV and other video stations on November 26, 1998.
1987	The video begins with Spears appearing bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta played the role of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, Spears runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, Spears is outside, now adorned in a pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, Spears begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and Spears leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, Spears is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.
1988	The schoolgirl outfit is considered to be one of Spears's iconic looks and is on display at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. The ensemble caused controversy among parents associations for showing the midriff of a sixteen-year-old. Spears faced the criticism saying, "Me showing my belly? I'm from the South; you're stupid if you don't wear a sports bra [when you] go to dance class, you're going to be sweating your butt off." In 1999, "...Baby One More Time" earned Spears her first three MTV Video Music Award nominations, in the categories of Best Pop Video, Best Choreography, and Best Female Video. In a list compiled by VH1 in 2001, it was listed at number ninety in the best videos of all time. The video was the first of fourteen of her videos to retire on MTV's television series TRL. On its final episode, a three-hour special aired on November 16, 2008, "…Baby One More Time" was number one in their final countdown as the most iconic music video of all time and was the last video to be played on the show. Wesley Yang in his essay "Inside the Box" in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's "Girlschool" because it featured "a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [..] But that was a sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an inflection point in the culture". The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, "Stronger" where Spears sings, "My loneliness ain't killing me no more" – a reference to "...Baby One More Time" where she sings, "My loneliness is killing me." The music video is also referenced in the 2009 single, "If U Seek Amy". After she comes out of the house dressed as a housewife, her daughter is dressed with a similar schoolgirl outfit while wearing pink ribbons in her hair. The video was ranked at number four on a list of the ten most controversial music videos in pop by AOL on September 29, 2011. In April 2014, the music video for "...Baby One More Time" reached over 100 million views on VEVO becoming Spears' 5th music video to do so and making it the first '90s video by a female singer to receive a certification. As of April 2021, the music video accumulated over 600 million views on YouTube.
1989	The very first live performance of the song was at the "Singapore Jazz Festival" in Singapore on May 16, 1998. That day, she also performed for the first time ever, the song "Sometimes".  Britney performed "...Baby One More Time" on several occasions. She performed the song on July 6, 1999, during her appearance at the Woodstock 99 festival. Neil Strauss, from The New York Times, noted that "all the backing music was on tape, and most of the vocals were recorded, with Ms. Spears just reinforcing selected words in choruses and singing an occasional snippet of a verse". It was also performed at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards; after a classroom roll call ended, Spears appeared on the stage and began performing the song. Halfway through, she was joined by Justin Timberlake and the members of NSYNC for a dance routine. Afterwards, the band performed their hit "Tearin' Up My Heart". The song was also performed at the 1999 MTV Europe Music Awards, along with "(You Drive Me) Crazy", the 1999 Billboard Music Awards, the 1999 Smash Hits Poll Winners Party, the Christmas Day edition of Top of the Pops and the Greenwich Millennium concert on 31 December 1999, she also performed it with broadcasters David Dimbleby and Michael Buerk on 2000 Today. Spears performed the song in a medley with "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart" at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Spears was wearing a turtleneck and a full tulle skirt at the beginning of the performance, while dancers surrounded her with enormous hand fans. After singing a shortened version of the song, she then took a few moments to shuffle into a form-fitting red rhinestone outfit (with side cutouts) and emerged onto a stage to perform "...Baby One More Time." Spears was also criticized of lipsynching the song during her performance. Later, in 2003, Spears performed the song in a remixed form at Britney Spears: In the Zone, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. "...Baby One More Time" was also performed at the 2003 NFL Kickoff Live on September 4, 2003, at the National Mall, in a medley with "I'm a Slave 4 U" (2001), which included pyrotechnics. She sported shoulder-length blond hair and was dressed in black football pants, a black-and-white referee halter top and boots from Reebok. Her outfit was later auctioned off to benefit the Britney Spears Foundation.
1990	"...Baby One More Time" has been performed in seven of Spears's concert tours since its release. On ...Baby One More Time Tour, the encore consisted of a performance of the song, in which Spears wore a black bra under pink halter, a pink sequined plaid mini-skirt, and black thigh-high stockings. On 2000s Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, "...Baby One More Time" was performed after a dance interlude in which the dancers showed their individual moves while their names appeared on the screens. Spears took the stage in a conservative schoolgirl outfit to perform the song. She ripped it off halfway through the song to reveal a cheerleader ensemble. The song was also the encore of 2001's Dream Within a Dream Tour. It began with a giant projection of a hologram of Spears onto a water screen. The projection gradually shrunk until Spears rose from the stage while wearing a plastic cowboy hat, blue hip-huggers, and a matching bra top. She began performing "...Baby One More Time" in a ballad version until reaching the end of the runway. Pyrotechnics surrounded the stage while the song changed to a more uptempo version with elements of techno.
1991	On The Onyx Hotel Tour, after performing "Showdown", a video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a corset to perform "…Baby One More Time" along with "Oops!...I Did It Again" and "(You Drive Me) Crazy". All of the three were reworked for the show with elements of jazz and blues. "...Baby One More Time" was also performed on the promotional tour made on some House of Blues locations, called The M+M's Tour. The show started with Spears singing a short version of the song dressed in a white go-go boots, a white miniskirt and a sparkling pink bikini top. On The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the song made into the Electro Circ act. It was the final song of the act, performed after "Toxic".

1992	"…Baby One More Time" has been covered on numerous occasions. One of the earliest live covers of the song was by the Scottish band Travis, recorded during one of their concerts at "The Bay Tavern" in Robin Hood's Bay, North Yorkshire, England. The song was later included in the release of their 1999 single, "Turn". Lead singer Francis Healey said, "We did it for a laugh the first time. [..] And as we played it, the irony slipped from my smile. It's a very well-crafted song. It [has] that magic thing." The Guardian said this cover showed a new and more "dark" side of the band, commenting "slowed down to a mournful crawl, it was amazing how ominous the couplet "This loneliness is killing me / Hit me, baby, one more time" sounded". PopWreckoning.com called it "perhaps the most well done cover of Britney's catalyst to eternal fame". Spears heard their version while shopping in a mall and said, "It was so weird. I liked it though, I thought it was cool. It was a very different vibe from what I did".In July 2005, the Dresden Dolls performed a cover during their summer concerts while opening for Panic! at the Disco. On July 18, 2006, frontman Brendon Urie joined the band to perform the song in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. PopWreckoning.com said the cover was "a strange twist to this pop ditty. It's obviously darker and actually tortured as opposed to Britney's school girl despair".
1993	On July 13, 2009, Tori Amos covered the song live during her Sinful Attraction Tour at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California. On October 15, that year, Kris Allen covered the song for the first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His rendition received positive reviews.

In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for Soup for the soundtrack of the film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was "really, really, dark and really rock, [..] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that we usually do." In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is "as redolent and fetching as any of [Fountains of Wayne]'s peaks".
1994	In the 2010 Glee episode "Britney/Brittany", the character of Rachel Berry, played by Lea Michele, covered the song using similar outfits to the ones of the music video. Spears also made a cameo, taking the teacher's role, previously played by Cullota. Darren Criss also of Glee performed a mash-up of "...Baby One More Time" with "Für Elise" on Sing Out, Raise Hope for The Trevor Project and the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation in December 2011.

1995	In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number one on a list of the 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time. Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's "sexy and coy" vocals on the track "kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come."

In April 2005, the British TV network ITV aired a short series called Hit Me, Baby, One More Time hosted by Vernon Kay. The show pitted one-hit wonders who generally had their moments of fame in the 1980s against each other to play their own hits and a currently popular cover song. The favorites were chosen by audience voting. The American version of the show also aired on NBC later in the year, and it was also hosted by Kay. In the 2012 poll created by The Official Chart Company and ITV to discover The Nation's Favourite Number 1 Single of all-time, "…Baby One More Time" was listed as the seventh favorite song by the United Kingdom. In 2018, readers of German teen magazine Bravo voted "...Baby One More Time" to be the biggest hit since its first music compilation was released in 1992.
1996	Rolling Stone wrote that she "spearheaded the rise of post-millennial teen pop ... Spears early on cultivated a mixture of innocence and experience that generated lots of cash". Barbara Ellen of The Observer has reported: "Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena — a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall. Whereas other children develop at their own pace, Britney was developing at a pace set by the ferociously competitive American entertainment industry".
1997	Scott Plagenhoef of Pitchfork noted: "songs like Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit", Dr. Dre's "Nothing But a G Thang", and Britney Spears's " ... Baby One More Time" altered the landscape of pop culture so quickly in large part because they were delivered to all corners of the U.S. simultaneously by MTV. ... MTV's ability to place a song and musician into the pop music conversation was unparalleled at the time, and by the end of the decade that meant absurd levels of both financial and creative commitment to music videos." PopMatters's writer Evan Sawdey commented that Spears's concept for the song's music video was the one responsible for her immediate success, saying that, as a result, the singer "scored a massive No. 1 single, inadvertently started the late '90s teen pop boom, and created a public persona for herself that was simultaneously kid-friendly and pure male fantasy. Her videos got played on both MTV and the Disney Channel at the same time, showing just how well Spears (and her armies of PR handlers) managed to walk that fine line between family-friendly pop idol and unabashed sex object."
1998	The ...Baby One More Time Tour was the debut concert tour by American entertainer Britney Spears. It supported her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time (1999), and visited the United States and Canada. The tour was announced in March 1999, with dates released a month later. Tommy Hilfiger was chosen as the tour sponsor. The show was divided into various segments, with each segment being followed by an interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The setlist consisted of songs from her debut album and several covers. The tour received positive feedback from critics; many highlighted Spears' persona and edgy look.
1999	Spears talked to CNN about her involvement during the development of the tour, stating that she had designed the entire tour herself, including costumes and concept. Spears worked with fashion designer Gia Ventola to create the costumes for her and the dancers. The proscenium stage was simple and had only one main prop, a staircase in the middle. The band was in both sides of the staircase and consisted of five musicians. There were also six dancers, that took the stage during interludes. The setlist consisted of eight songs from her debut album and several covers by well-known artists.

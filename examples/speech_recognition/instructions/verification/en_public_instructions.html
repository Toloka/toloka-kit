Each task contains a text and a audio record. You need to check if that pair is correct.

<h4>The pair is <b>correct</b> if:</h4>
<ul>
	<li> The record content corresponds to text content.</li>
	<li> The record does <b>not</b> contain grammatical or pronunciation errors <i>(names that differ in pronunciation from a common noun are considered correct pronunciation)</i>.</li>
	<li> The text does <b>not</b> contain sentences, which are <b>not</b> recorded.</li>
	<li> The record sound is clear enough, there are <b>no</b> extraneous noise.</li>
</ul>

<h4>All others pairs are <b>incorrect</b>.</h4>

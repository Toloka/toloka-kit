    "\n",
    "    But it will be helpful to cross-check that the user has attached real photographs of the place you required. For example, check panorama views on Yandex or Google Maps. Or an old photo of the same place, if you have one.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Secondly, you need to remember what you pay the performer, even if the object does not exist on the spot. It is not the fault of the performer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The performer came and verified this information for you, and for that work should be paid with the same reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the third, field tasks usually converge much slower, and there is no point in waiting for the entire pool to close. We suggest retrieving completed tasks from the pool and sending them for verification periodically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This allows you to collect information faster. And the performers get the well-deserved reward more quickly."
